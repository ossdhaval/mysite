## installing Anaconda 3

Do you wish to update your shell profile to automatically initialize conda?
This will activate conda on startup and change the command prompt when activated.
If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup,
   run the following command when conda is activated:

conda config --set auto_activate_base false

You can undo this by running `conda init --reverse $SHELL`? [yes|no]

```

#### How to run python code locally:

- activate the python environment. For example, `conda activate base`
- run python program: `python3 /tmp/p1-self.py`

  
#### indentation and spaces rules

- Blank lines are ignored
- Indentation is mandatory in Python to indicate blocks of code such as those following statements like if, for, while, def, and class.
- Each indented block must use consistent whitespace; mixing the number of spaces or tabs within the same block causes errors.
- The standard convention is to use 4 spaces per indentation level.

In summary, Python uses indentation not just for readability but as a core part of the syntax to define program structure, with 4 spaces per level being the widely accepted standard.


Indentation applies to all lines that belong to the same block and must be uniform in that block.
