## Installations

- install anaconda
- `conda activate base`
- 
- install pydotplus : `conda install pydotplus`
- install tensorflow-gpu. Tensorflow installation using the command `conda install tensorflow-gpu` fails if your environment is using the latest python 3.13. At this moment the latest supported python
  is by tensoflow is `3.12`. So we neeed to downgrade the python to install tensorflow using `conda install python=3.12 `. Then install tensorflow `conda install tensorflow-gpu`
- download course material from: https://www.sundog-education.com/machine-learning/. Unzip the file in a directory (e.g `~/docs/learning/tech/certifications/ai/udemy-ml-ds-ai-course/MLCourse`). Open terminal and `cd` to that directory. Then type `jupyter notebook`. A browser should open with your notebooks.
