## Installations

- install anaconda
- `conda activate base`
- 
- install pydotplus : `conda install pydotplus`
- install tensorflow-gpu. Tensorflow installation using the command `conda install tensorflow-gpu` fails if your environment is using the latest python 3.13. At this moment the latest supported python
  is by tensoflow is `3.12`. So we neeed to downgrade the python to install tensorflow using `conda install python=3.12 `. Then install tensorflow `conda install tensorflow-gpu`
- download course material from: https://www.sundog-education.com/machine-learning/. Unzip the file in a directory (e.g `~/docs/learning/tech/certifications/ai/udemy-ml-ds-ai-course/MLCourse`). Open terminal and `cd` to that directory. Then type `jupyter notebook`. A browser should open with your notebooks. 

## statistics

- Mean: aka average. It doesn't give correct idea if your data has outliers.
- Median: sort the sample data and pick the one in the middle, that is your median. Outliers doesn't impact median. This is often a better measure if your data has outliers.
- Mode: is the most frequetly occuring value in your data.

- Histogram: A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data, where the data is grouped into continuous intervals called bins. It consists of adjacent rectangular bars where each bar's height corresponds to the frequency (count) of data points within that bin. Unlike bar graphs, histograms have no space between bars because the bins represent continuous data ranges. The width of each bar represents the interval of values, and the area or height of the bars indicates how often data in those intervals occur, helping to visualize how data is spread, concentrated, or if there are any gaps or patterns in the dataset.
