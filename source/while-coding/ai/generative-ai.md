## important terms:

- Knowledge cutoff: Most recent Time/date when model's training data was updated.

## mental notes:

- Normal NLP vs LLM based gen ai project
  - In normal NLP project,
    1. you label the data
    2. and then train your neural network(model)
    3. and then you build your application that calls that model and passes a parameter
  - In LLM based project, you directly build an application (step-3 above) to call a pretrained ai model (like chatgpt, perplexity etc)
  - Because of this, building LLM based application is very fast and easy. And that is because lot of people are creating such applications that are just wrappers on top of an third-party LLM.
