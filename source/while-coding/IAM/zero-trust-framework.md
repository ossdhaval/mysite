# Zero Trust Framework





The **Zero Trust Framework** is a cybersecurity model that assumes **no entityâ€”inside or outside a networkâ€”should be trusted by default**. Instead of relying on traditional perimeter security (where users and devices inside a network are inherently trusted), Zero Trust continuously verifies and enforces security at every level.

### **Core Principles of Zero Trust**
1. **Verify Explicitly** â€“ Always authenticate and authorize users, devices, and applications based on multiple factors (e.g., MFA, device health, location).
2. **Least Privilege Access** â€“ Grant only the minimum access necessary for users and systems to perform their tasks.
3. **Assume Breach** â€“ Operate as if a breach has already occurred, segment networks, and monitor all activity to detect threats.
4. **Micro-Segmentation** â€“ Divide the network into small, isolated zones to limit an attackerâ€™s lateral movement.
5. **Continuous Monitoring & Logging** â€“ Regularly inspect and analyze network traffic, user behavior, and device activity.
6. **Device & Endpoint Security** â€“ Ensure devices accessing the network are compliant and secure before granting access.

### **Key Technologies Supporting Zero Trust**
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** â€“ Enforces strict authentication and authorization policies.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** â€“ Requires more than just a password for access.
- **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** â€“ Protects and monitors devices for potential threats.
- **Network Segmentation & Micro-Segmentation** â€“ Limits access between systems to reduce risk.
- **Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)** â€“ Centralizes logging and threat detection.
- **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)** â€“ Replaces traditional VPNs, granting access only to specific applications instead of entire networks.

### **Benefits of Zero Trust**
âœ… Minimizes security risks by limiting trust assumptions.  
âœ… Reduces the impact of breaches by restricting lateral movement.  
âœ… Enhances visibility and control over network activity.  
âœ… Supports modern, cloud-first IT environments.  

Many organizations, including governments and enterprises, are adopting **Zero Trust** to secure remote work, cloud environments, and critical infrastructure.

Let's take an example of an **enterprise network** before and after implementing **Zero Trust**.

## **Scenario: A Corporate Network with Traditional Security (Non-Zero Trust)**
### **Setup:**
- Employees work from both the office and remote locations.
- The company uses an on-premises **Active Directory** for authentication.
- A **VPN** is used for remote access.
- Internal applications are hosted on company servers.
- Employees can access the entire internal network once authenticated.

### **How It Works (Non-Zero Trust Behavior):**
1. **User Authentication**: Employees enter their username and password to connect to the companyâ€™s VPN.
2. **Network Access Granted**: Once connected, they have access to all resources on the network (email, internal file shares, HR systems, customer databases, etc.).
3. **Lateral Movement Possible**: If an attacker steals an employeeâ€™s credentials, they can access everything inside the network without further security checks.
4. **Minimal Segmentation**: Employees from different departments can potentially access resources they donâ€™t need.
5. **Device Security Not Enforced**: The VPN does not check if the device is secure before allowing access.

### **Security Risks in Non-Zero Trust:**
ðŸš¨ **Credential Theft**: A hacker who gets an employeeâ€™s VPN credentials gains full network access.  
ðŸš¨ **Lateral Movement**: Once inside, attackers can move between systems freely.  
ðŸš¨ **No Device Validation**: An infected or unpatched device can introduce malware into the network.

## **Same Network with Zero Trust Implementation**
### **Changes Made:**
- VPN access is replaced with **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)**.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is enforced for all logins.
- **Least Privilege Access** is applied (users only get access to the resources they need).
- **Device Security Checks** are required before granting access.
- **Micro-Segmentation** is applied (HR, Finance, and IT have separate access zones).

### **How It Works (Zero Trust Behavior):**
1. **User Authentication**: Employees must use MFA (e.g., password + biometric or security key).
2. **Context-Based Access**: Access is granted based on:
   - **User identity** (job role, department)
   - **Device security** (Is the device patched? Does it have antivirus?)
   - **Location** (Is the user logging in from an unusual country?)
3. **Application-Specific Access**: Instead of giving network-wide access, employees get access to **only the applications they need** (e.g., HR employees can access payroll, but not IT systems).
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: The system continuously checks for unusual activity (e.g., multiple failed login attempts, access from a suspicious location).
5. **Lateral Movement Prevention**: If an attacker compromises one system, they **cannot move laterally** to other systems because each access request is re-verified.

### **Security Benefits in Zero Trust:**
âœ… **Reduced Attack Surface**: Even if credentials are stolen, access is limited.  
âœ… **Blocked Lateral Movement**: Attackers canâ€™t hop between systems freely.  
âœ… **Better Compliance**: Sensitive data access is controlled and logged.  
âœ… **Stronger Device Security**: Only secure, approved devices can access resources.

## **Conclusion:**
ðŸ”´ **Non-Zero Trust**: "Once you're in, you have access to everything."  
ðŸŸ¢ **Zero Trust**: "Every access request must be verifiedâ€”who you are, what you're accessing, and whether your device is secure."
