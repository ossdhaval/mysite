# VSCode Notes

## Shortcuts


- ctrl+shit+p: command palette

## cloning a new project from Github

- From explorer, open the parent folder where you want to store the code
- now you can either use the command palette and search for `git clone` to get the code, or use terminal and use git commands to get the code
  - command palette: If you use this, the VScode will require login to the github
  - using terminal it is easy.
    - go to the parent folder where you want to clone the repo. For example `/home/xyz/vscode`
    - then check if you have a `.git` directory already there. If it exists, then the parent directory is already initialized. You don't have to run `git init`. Else run `git init`
    - then run `git clone <https-url-for-cloning-the-repo>`
    - This will create a new directory under the parent with the code from github `/home/xyz/vscode/my-repo`
- in vscode, you should download extension from microsoft `extension pack for java`. This extension pack installs 6 extensions to support java development.
