### What is ICP?

An Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) in marketing is a detailed description of the perfect 
customer or company that would benefit most from a product or service while 
providing maximum value in return. It serves as a strategic guide for aligning sales and
marketing efforts toward high-value prospects most likely to convert, remain loyal, and drive revenue growth.
