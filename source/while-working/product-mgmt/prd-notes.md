# PRD Notes

## PRD created using ChatPRD.ai


Inputs:
----------------------------------------------

prompt-1:

create an app that lets parents and kids create and share a wishlist of gifts for upcoming birthdays. A link can be shared with invitees. Invitees can see the wishlist and choose the gift that they'll be giving. Two invitees can share expense of one gift and give it collectively.

Ans-1

Nice idea — I can help. Quick questions to make feedback actionable:

1. Primary goal: validate concept, prioritize features, draft a PRD, or create investor-facing pitch?
2. Target audience: parents only, parents + kids, extended family, friends, or event hosts?
3. Platform(s): mobile (iOS/Android), web, or both?
4. Payments & logistics: do you want integrated payments/split-payments + shipping, or just reservation/claiming with external fulfillment?
5. Privacy & visibility: should wishlists be public via link, invite-only, or support anonymous contributors?
6. Gift sharing rules: max contributors per gift? automatic split calculation? deadlines for claiming?
7. UX questions: should kids be able to edit lists independently or only with parental approval?
8. Monetization: commissions, featured listings, ads, premium features, or none?
9. Any regulatory/age constraints or countries to support at launch?
10. Deliverable preference: quick bulleted critique, prioritized feature list, or a full PRD (I can draft one).

Tell me answers (or skip ones you don’t care about). I’ll then give a focused critique and proposed next steps — or I can draft the PRD immediately if you pick that.

# WishShare — Family Gift Wishlist (India) PRD

### TL;DR

WishShare is a mobile app for parents in India to create and share curated gift wishlists for their children’s birthdays. The app enables parents to easily share a public link with invitees, who can reserve gifts and split contributions, while WishShare earns commissions on successful reservations. The MVP focuses on reservation and split calculation, with external fulfillment and no in-app payments at launch.

---

## Goals

### Business Goals

* Achieve 10,000 wishlist creations within 90 days of launch.

* Drive at least 30% of wishlists to have one or more items reserved by invitees.

* Generate initial commission revenue from at least 20% of reserved gifts.

* Establish partnerships with 3+ major Indian e-commerce retailers for product link integration.

* Maintain a reservation success rate (no double-claims) above 99%.

### User Goals

* Allow parents to easily create and manage a wishlist for their child’s birthday.

* Enable seamless sharing of the wishlist link with family and friends.

* Ensure invitees can reserve gifts and coordinate split contributions without confusion.

* Provide clear visibility to parents on which gifts are claimed and by whom.

* Reduce duplicate gifting and social friction around gift selection.

### Non-Goals

* No child or non-parent editing of wishlists in the MVP.

* No in-app payment processing or direct fulfillment at launch.

* No support for anonymous or invite-only wishlists in the MVP (public link only).

---

## User Personas & Stories

### Parent Organizer (Primary User)

* As a parent, I want to create a wishlist for my child’s birthday, so that I can guide friends and family on what gifts are most suitable.

* As a parent, I want to add items from any online retailer or enter custom gifts, so that the wishlist is flexible.

* As a parent, I want to share a single link with all invitees, so that I don’t have to coordinate individually.

* As a parent, I want to see which gifts have been reserved and by whom, so that I can avoid duplicate gifts.

* As a parent, I want to set a deadline for reservations, so that invitees respond in time.

### Invitee (Family Member or Friend)

* As an invitee, I want to view the wishlist without creating an account, so that it’s easy to participate.

* As an invitee, I want to reserve a gift, so that others know I am giving it.

* As an invitee, I want to split the cost of a gift with another person, so that we can give a more expensive gift together.

* As an invitee, I want to see which gifts are already reserved, so that I don’t pick the same one.

* As an invitee, I want to receive a reminder if I haven’t reserved a gift before the deadline, so that I don’t forget.

### Occasional Contributor (Edge Case)

* As an occasional contributor, I want to join an existing split contribution, so that I can participate even if I can’t afford the full gift.

* As an occasional contributor, I want to see if a reservation has expired, so that I know if I can claim it.

* As an occasional contributor, I want to cancel my reservation if I change my mind, so that others can claim the gift.

* As an occasional contributor, I want to see the total number of contributors for a split gift, so that I know how much I need to pay.

* As an occasional contributor, I want to avoid seeing personal information of other contributors, so that my privacy is protected.

## Narrative

Priya, a mother in Bengaluru, wants to make her son Aarav’s 7th birthday special. She’s tired of receiving duplicate gifts and wants to make it easier for her family to choose something Aarav will truly love. Priya downloads WishShare, quickly creates a wishlist with toys, books, and a cricket set, and sets a reservation deadline a week before the party. She shares the link with her family WhatsApp group.

Aarav’s uncle and aunt open the link, see the wishlist, and decide to reserve the cricket set together using the split contribution feature. The app calculates their share and confirms their reservation. Priya’s sister picks a book and reserves it in one tap. As the deadline approaches, Priya receives notifications showing which gifts are claimed and by whom, giving her peace of mind that there will be no duplicates.

On the day of the party, Aarav receives the gifts he wanted, and Priya’s family feels happy to have contributed meaningfully. WishShare earns a commission on the reserved items, and Priya recommends the app to her friends. The experience is seamless, transparent, and joyful for everyone involved.

```

Prompt -3

suggest how to monetise this app

Ans:

```
Good — here are focused, actionable monetization options for WishShare (India), ranked and with implementation notes and trade-offs.

Core (highest priority)
- Platform commission on fulfilled purchases (affiliate/referral): earn ~5–12% by partnering with major Indian e‑commerce platforms (Flipkart, Amazon, Myntra) and local merchants. Low friction for users; reliable volume play. Trade-off: requires partner integrations and tracking.
- Convenience fee on reservations/payments: charge a small fixed fee (₹10–₹50) per claimed gift or a 1–3% processing fee for split-pay collections. Predictable revenue and easier to explain. Risk: sensitivity to fees for low-value gifts.

Feature / product-led revenue
- Premium family tier (monthly/yearly): ₹99–₹299/month or ₹699–₹1,999/year with features: unlimited wishlists, priority placement in share link, no convenience fees, smart gift suggestions, calendar sync, locked parental controls, advanced analytics (who viewed/when). Good ARPU; conversion depends on perceived value.
- Featured placement / promoted gifts: merchants or parents can pay to pin or highlight items in a wishlist or in discovery flows. High-margin but must avoid degrading trust.

Transaction-adjacent services
- Gift contribution management / escrow: hold pooled contributions until deadline; charge 1–2% escrow fee. Reduces failed payments and increases completion rates; requires stronger compliance/KYC for payments.
- Gift wrapping / concierge + shipping referrals: partner with local vendors and collect referral fees or markups. Higher margin but needs logistics partnerships.

Marketplace and merchant partnerships
- Affiliate store / curated marketplace: show merchants within the app; take referral fees and run co-marketing with brands targeting parents/children. Drives stickiness and monetizes browsing behavior.
- Bulk/offline gifting for extended family (corporate gifting): offering corporate/large-family packages for festivals; higher ticket size and margins.

Advertising & data
- Non-intrusive contextual ads: only in discovery or merchant browse (no ads on private wishlists). Low-yield; risk to UX.
- Aggregated insights for brands (anonymized): trends, popular gifts by age/region — sell as periodic reports or APIs. Must ensure strict privacy and compliance.

Growth-to-revenue levers (recommended sequence)
1. Launch with reservation + affiliate links + small convenience fee to validate conversion and partner tracking.  
2. Introduce split-pay escrow and convenience fee once group payments scale.  
3. Add premium subscription with clear, measurable benefits (no fees, priority links) at month 3–6.  
4. Open merchant partnerships and promoted placements after user base and usage patterns are clear.  
5. Explore concierge/wrapping and B2B packages once logistics partners are secured.

Pricing guidance and KPIs
- Commission: start 5–8% for affiliates; test up to 12% with exclusive partners.  
- Convenience/escrow fee: ₹10–₹50 or 1–3% per transaction.  
- Subscription price: test ₹99/mo and ₹699/yr; target 2–5% conversion of active families.  
- KPIs to track: take rate (net rev / GMV), conversion from view→claim, split-pay completion rate, ARPU by cohort, churn for premium, CAC payback.

Risks & mitigations
- Fee sensitivity: mitigate with a clear value proposition (guaranteed claim, escrow safety, no duplicate gifts).  
- Partner dependence: diversify merchant partners, add direct merchant onboarding for high-margin SKUs.  
- Trust/privacy: be transparent on data use and keep wishlists private-by‑link.

Pick two monetization paths you want prioritized (e.g., affiliate + convenience fee; or premium + escrow) and I’ll map required product changes, partner types, and a 3‑month revenue experiment plan.

Registry-focused platforms (wider registry + group gifting)
- Zola / Joy / MyRegistry — universal registries (weddings but also general registries) with add-from-any-store and group gift options. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zola_%28company%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2024/07/22/shopping/why-with-joy-serves-as-a-great-wedding-registry-destination/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [brides.com](https://www.brides.com/what-to-know-about-universal-wedding-registries-5324095?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

- Elfster — Secret-Santa and wishlist + claiming features popular for groups. ([southernliving.com](https://www.southernliving.com/secret-santa-app-elfster-8752355?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Notes on the competitive landscape
- Two clusters matter most: (1) wishlist/registry apps that focus on discovery and preventing duplicate gifts (Giftful, Giftster, Listery, universal registries), and (2) group-pay/pooling tools that handle money collection and split payments (GroupTogether, MyPoolin, UPI-based apps). Integrating both well is a market gap. ([marketingscoop.com](https://www.marketingscoop.com/tech/10-universal-wishlist-apps-to-effortlessly-track-and-share-products-2023/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [the-sun.com](https://www.the-sun.com/shopping/14955779/group-together-new-greeting-cards-save/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyPoolin?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Want a prioritized competitor map (feature-by-feature, UX screenshots, and what to copy/avoid) for your PRD? Which three competitors should I analyze in depth?
```

Prompt - 5

let's prioritize competitor map. We are focused on preventing duplicate gifts and getting more useful and meaningful gifts. We don't want to handle payments.

Ans - 5

```

I reviewed your PRD. Below is a prioritized competitor map focused on duplicate-prevention and improving gift relevance (no payments).

Top competitors to analyze (ranked)
1. Giftster — family-centered wishlists; strong at duplicate prevention and cross-device syncing.  
2. Giftful — shareable wishlists + group-gift reservation; good UX for claiming items.  
3. Listery — mobile-first list aggregation from multiple stores; simple sharing and add-from-web.  
4. MyRegistry / MyRegistry-like universal registries (Zola-style) — powerful add-from-any-store and duplication checks at scale.  
5. Elfster — wishlist + Secret-Santa; good social features that drive meaningful gift selection.  
6. GroupTogether (feature-level) — group-gift coordination (useful UX patterns for contributors, but payment-focused).

Feature-by-feature comparison (what matters for your goals)
- Add-from-any-store / browser clipper
  - Winners: Listery, MyRegistry — easy aggregation reduces manual entries and increases relevance.
  - Opportunity: Many apps miss localized Indian merchants and UPI/WhatsApp flows.
- Duplicate detection & reservation
  - Winners: Giftster, Giftful — realtime claiming, visible “reserved by X” badges, and expiry windows.
  - Gap: Few offer intelligent duplicate alerts for similar SKUs (e.g., same toy model at different sellers).
- Social signals & context (why this gift matters)
  - Winners: Elfster, Giftful — comments, senders’ notes, gift stories increase meaning.
  - Gap: Limited structured prompts (e.g., “Why child wants this / occasion relevance / size/color”).
- Guidance for useful gifts (age-fit, longevity, educational value)
  - Winners: N/A (mostly manual) — registries rarely score gifts for “usefulness.”  
  - Opportunity: algorithmic tagging (age appropriateness, developmental benefits) plus curator badges.
- Frictionless sharing/viewing (no-login link access)
  - Winners: Giftful, Giftster — link-based access and SMS/WhatsApp friendly.
  - Your PRD already targets this; good competitive parity.
- Group-claiming without payments
  - Winners: Giftful supports reservation; GroupTogether handles money.  
  - Opportunity: allow multi-invitee reservation commitment (e.g., pledge %/role) without collecting funds.
- Privacy / parental control
  - Winners: Giftster (family privacy controls).  
  - Must-have: parent-only edit + child-preview mode per your spec.

Gaps in market (opportunities to win)
- Localized store integrations for India (Flipkart, Amazon India, FirstCry, local kirana/brands). Many competitors focus Western stores.  
- Intelligent duplicate detection across SKUs and variants (model, size, color, UPC/title similarity).  
- Structured context fields that encourage more meaningful gifts (reason, how it will be used, longevity score).  
- “Intent to buy” commitments (non-payment pledges) and soft reservations with deadline escalation (reminder nudges, reassignment if expired).  
- Curated suggestions prioritized by age, educational value, eco/fair-trade badges — help parents craft more useful lists.  
- Social proof from family (ratings, past-gift success) to guide meaningful choices.

What to copy (fast wins)
- Link-based viewing + one-tap reserve (Giftful/Giftster UX).  
- Browser/mobile clipper to add items from any store (Listery/MyRegistry).  
- Visible reservation badges and expiry timers (Giftster/Giftful).

What to avoid or change
- Avoid over-reliance on manual list entry — increases friction.  
- Avoid payment-first UX patterns (GroupTogether) since you won’t handle payments; instead use clear pledge/reservation states.  
- Avoid generic discovery feeds that push merchants over useful/age‑appropriate suggestions.

Recommended product features to prioritize (MVP)
1. Add-from-any-store mobile clipper + manual add with image/title/URL/price.  
2. Robust duplicate-detection engine (title/UPC/image similarity + variant matching) with admin override.  
3. Link-sharing with no-login view and one-tap “Reserve” (show reserver name + pledge note).  
4. Multi-person pledge (e.g., “I’ll chip in” toggle) without money handling; support deadline and automatic release on expiry.  
5. Structured gift-context fields: age range, why wanted, usage frequency, durability score (parent inputs).  
6. Curated suggestions/rules engine that scores items for usefulness and surfaces alternatives.  
7. Nudges & reassignment flows: reminders before deadline, automatic suggestions for unreserved high-priority items.

Quick experiment plan (first 8 weeks)
- Week 0–2: Build clipper + add-item flow + shareable link + simple reserve toggle.  
- Week 3–5: Implement duplicate-detection and visible reservation/expiry badges.  
- Week 6–8: Add structured gift-context fields + basic suggestion engine; run 50-family pilot in one Indian city (WhatsApp distribution).

If you want, I’ll: (A) create a competitor feature matrix (spreadsheet) with exact UX examples and screenshots for the six competitors; or (B) draft the MVP feature spec and 8-week roadmap to implement the prioritized features. Which do you prefer?

```

Prompt: How profitable is the giftster? what is the revenue? and major markets?

Ans:

```
Short answer: Giftster is a privately held company so it does not publish full financial statements or public profit figures. Public signals we can cite:

- Giftster reports >2 million members (2023) and says tracked conversion dollar volume sent to retail partners totaled about $102M in 2024. ([giftster.com](https://www.giftster.com/advertising/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/tc/news-release/2024/08/07/2926263/0/en/Giftster-Announces-the-All-New-Android-Phone-Tablet-App-for-Sharing-Gift-Wish-Lists-Among-Family.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
- Giftster’s site and traffic estimates show the United States is its largest market, with sizable audiences in Canada, the UK and some European countries; Giftster states it has active members in ~40 countries. ([giftster.com](https://www.giftster.com/advertising/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [help.giftster.com](https://help.giftster.com/article/45-international-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [sem.jupiterseotool.com](https://sem.jupiterseotool.com/website/giftster.com/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

What we can infer (with assumptions)
- Revenue: Giftster relies largely on affiliate/referral fees and limited advertising/partner deals. Using the $102M in partner-directed GMV (2024) and a plausible affiliate take-rate of 3–8% implies estimated gross revenue from affiliate/referral activity in the range of roughly $3M–$8M for that activity alone (this is an estimate, not an official figure). Profitability cannot be determined from this alone because operating costs, other revenue streams, and margins are private. (I’m making this inference from the cited GMV + typical affiliate rates; it should be verified with Giftster or a financial database for accuracy). ([giftster.com](https://www.giftster.com/advertising/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Major markets
- Primary: United States (largest share of traffic and the company’s stated majority audience).  
- Secondary: Canada, United Kingdom, parts of Europe (traffic tools list Switzerland notably), and smaller pockets worldwide (Giftster claims activity in ~40 countries). ([sem.jupiterseotool.com](https://sem.jupiterseotool.com/website/giftster.com/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [help.giftster.com](https://help.giftster.com/article/45-international-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

If you want exact revenue or profit figures I can:
- Try to find interviews, press filings, or media reporting that cite company revenue or valuation (I’ll search company registries and news).  
- Or, if you prefer, I can build a short financial-estimate model using plausible affiliate rates, traffic-to-conversion assumptions, and subscription/other revenue scenarios — tell me which.
