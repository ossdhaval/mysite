- Project in maintainence mode. We are only fixing security issues and other on-demand issues. We have a scheduled 2 monthly release. 
- So strategic roadmap is not required since there is no feature development.
- What we need is to aling issues with future releases (created as milestones in the GH).
- Start with accumulating issues in GH, then groom these issues by adding more details about impact and issue type etc. Ask the issue author to do this.
- Once the issues are groomed, add priority to them in discussion with Mike.
- Once the priority is added, assign milestone to the issues. And let the developer know so that they have a say in the delivery timeline.

- Project is in development phase. We have features being added, bugs being fixed etc. We have a twice-a-month release schedule.
- Here, we will take a step by step approach. We will first create a roadmap with features and descriptions only. timelines will be quarterly, to decide which
  features are getting delivered when. This will help the team understand what is at the priority. This can be achieved by involving Mike and Mo.
  At this stage, we don't want to go down to the
  level of determining the content of each 15 day release. Because that will need lot of clarity from Mike's side and descipline and commitment from the developer side.
  In the second phase, we will try to aling features in the roadmap to the sub issues and tasks. Like a sprint planning, developers will participate to determine which issue
  can be delivered in which milestone(release).
- At the end of first phase: we will have clarity about the strategy, direction and quaterly timelines
- At the end of second phase: we will have clarity about the execution and the timelines. Release contents for upcoming releases.
