Four stages of product lifecycle. 

- introduction
  - Company has just introduced a new product. Need and the market for the product is still not proven
  - Only early adoptors are buying the product, so product is lossing money at this time due to little or no revenue
  - There are almost no or very few competitors in the market
- growth
  -  Products need and market has been proven to exist and consumers have accepted the product
  -  Wider base of consumers are quickly buying the product. Product sees a rapid growth in revenue month on month or year on year. Revenue growth is a good indicator of product being in the growth phase.
  -  Product starts to see new competition in the market with other players introducing similar products
- maturity
  - product revenue peaks. The market is mature with lot of competitors. 
- decline
  - product revenue declines. Products can be phased out at this point, or relaunched with new features etc. Strategy may vary.

Product development process or lifecycle stages

- conceive
- plan
- develop
- iterate
- launch
- steady
- maintain or kill
  

there is no definitive guide on how to tell in which phase your product is going through right now. There are only few characteristic of each phase by which you may be able to judge. There phases may also differe from product to product and market to market.

----------------------------------

agile has two styles: scrum and kanban

kanban is different from scrum 

- In Kanban doesn't timebox the work (as in 2 week or 4 week sprints). Kanban doesn't have sprints. Hence it doesn't have sprint backlog etc. But it has product backlog.
- Kanban has not prescribed any meeting types. Like stand up meeting, sprint planning, retrospective etc.
- In Kanban, the team should decide how many items can be in a particular state. For example, no more than 4 items in `in-progress` state.
- Kanban is suited for the team working on items where estimates do not vary too much and hence the team keeps on moving items to completion one-after-another. For example, customer service team working on tickets.
