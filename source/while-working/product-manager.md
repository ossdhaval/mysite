One thing that every Product Manager must understand is how every moving part of a
product interacts with other moving parts.

Four stages of product lifecycle. 

- introduction
  - Company has just introduced a new product. Need and the market for the product is still not proven
  - Only early adoptors are buying the product, so product is lossing money at this time due to little or no revenue
  - There are almost no or very few competitors in the market
- growth
  -  Products need and market has been proven to exist and consumers have accepted the product
  -  Wider base of consumers are quickly buying the product. Product sees a rapid growth in revenue month on month or year on year. Revenue growth is a good indicator of product being in the growth phase.
  -  Product starts to see new competition in the market with other players introducing similar products
- maturity
  - product revenue peaks. The market is mature with lot of competitors. 
- decline
  - product revenue declines. Products can be phased out at this point, or relaunched with new features etc. Strategy may vary.
 
20
-----------------------------

Product development process or lifecycle stages

- conceive
- plan
- develop
- iterate
- launch
- steady
- maintain or kill
  

there is no definitive guide on how to tell in which phase your product is going through right now. There are only few characteristic of each phase by which you may be able to judge. There phases may also differe from product to product and market to market. 

25
----------------------------------

agile has two styles: scrum and kanban

kanban is different from scrum 

- In Kanban doesn't timebox the work (as in 2 week or 4 week sprints). Kanban doesn't have sprints. Hence it doesn't have sprint backlog etc. But it has product backlog.
- Kanban has not prescribed any meeting types. Like stand up meeting, sprint planning, retrospective etc.
- In Kanban, the team should decide how many items can be in a particular state. For example, no more than 4 items in `in-progress` state.
- Kanban is suited for the team working on items where estimates do not vary too much and hence the team keeps on moving items to completion one-after-another. For example, customer service team working on tickets.

30
-----------------------------------------

- Sources of Ideas
  -  Employees (yourself, co-workers, management)
  -  Metrics (for example, pattern of UI usage)
  -  Users (user feedback via forums, emails, complaints etc)
  -  Clients (client feedback)
 
The difference between user vs client: 

Client is someone who pays. The term users is a broader term which may refer to free users. For example, I am a user of gmail. But if I pay for google business suit, then I am google's client.

When product is a B2B product, you might have client and users in the same organization. For example, if citibank buys a software, the decision to buy and the payment comes from a director level person, but then the software gets used by someone who actually reports to him/her. So from a feedback perspective, you may get feedback from a different perspective from the director about your product, while the person who is actually using the product may also give you a different feedback.

-------------------------------
compatitive market analysis: Question is that if the market that you are addressing is large enough to worth going into. This question comes when you are working on a feature or product that will put you in another market, or you are starting a fresh product.

There are two approaches to market sizing:

- Top down
- bottom up

### Top down

Here you think about number of potential users first. Then target a market share that you can capture considering the current competition.

This is an optimistic approach. Not preferred if you have an option to do a bottom up approach.

For example: 



Great question. Let‚Äôs take the **same fitness app targeting urban millennials in the U.S.** and apply a **top-down market sizing approach** instead.

---

### **Top-Down Market Sizing for the Fitness App**

#### **Step 1: Start with the Broad Market**

Start with the **total market size of the fitness and wellness industry** in the U.S.

* Let's say the U.S. fitness and wellness market is **\$35 billion/year** (based on industry reports).

#### **Step 2: Narrow Down to Your Product Category**

You're in the **digital fitness app** sub-segment.

* Digital fitness is about **10%** of the total fitness market ‚Üí
  \$35B √ó 10% = **\$3.5 billion**

#### **Step 3: Narrow Further by Demographic & Geography**

You're targeting **urban millennials**.

* Millennials make up \~22% of the U.S. population.
* Urban population is \~83% of the U.S. population.
* So, millennial urban share ‚âà 22% √ó 83% ‚âà **18% of total U.S. population**.

Apply that 18% to the digital fitness market:

* \$3.5B √ó 18% = **\$630 million**

#### **Step 4: Refine for Competitive Position / Market Share**

You might conservatively aim to capture **5% of that segment** over time.

* \$630M √ó 5% = **\$31.5 million** potential revenue for your app.

---

### ‚úÖ **Top-Down Estimate of Addressable Market: \~\$630 million**

### ‚úÖ **Your Target Share (SOM): \~\$31.5 million**

---




#### Bottom-up: 

Here you look at the current users base of your competition and see how much market share you can capture.

This approach is much more realistic because it looks at size of real users. Sizing using this approach takes more time. But it gives a conservative and more realistic number which is better than optimistic sizing using top down.

**example of bottom up sizing:**


Sure! Here's a different example of the **bottom-up market sizing** approach, this time for a **subscription-based fitness app** targeting urban millennials in the U.S.

---

### **Scenario**:

You‚Äôre launching a fitness app that costs **\$15 per month**, and you want to estimate the market size using a bottom-up approach.

---

### **Step-by-Step Bottom-Up Example**:

#### **1. Identify Your Target Segment**

* Target: Urban millennials (aged 25‚Äì40) in the U.S.
* According to census data, there are about **72 million millennials** in the U.S.
* Let‚Äôs assume **60% live in urban areas** ‚Üí **43.2 million** people.

#### **2. Estimate Adoption Rate**

* Not everyone will subscribe to a fitness app.
* Assume a realistic **penetration rate of 5%** based on competition and behavior trends ‚Üí
  **5% of 43.2 million = 2.16 million potential users**

#### **3. Calculate Annual Revenue Per User (ARPU)**

* Monthly subscription = \$15
* Annual revenue per user = \$15 √ó 12 = **\$180**

#### **4. Multiply to Get Market Size**

* Market size = 2.16 million users √ó \$180 = **\$388.8 million**

---

### ‚úÖ **Bottom-Up Market Size Estimate: \~\$389 million**

This estimate is grounded in actual user numbers, realistic assumptions about behavior, and product pricing, making it a strong case for early-stage planning or investor conversations.


#### üîÅ Comparing Approaches:

| Method    | Estimate        | Strength                  | Risk                        |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Bottom-Up | \~\$389 million | Grounded in user behavior | Slower, needs more data     |
| Top-Down  | \~\$630 million | Fast, uses existing data  | Depends on accurate filters |

Would you like a simple table or visual to compare these two methods side by side?



#### Other approaches From chatgpt


Product market sizing is the process of estimating the potential value or volume of a market for a particular product or service. There are several common methods to approach market sizing, broadly categorized into **top-down**, **bottom-up**, and **value-theory-based** approaches. Here's a breakdown:


##### 3. **Value-Theory (or Economic-Value) Based Sizing**

This approach estimates how much value your product creates and how much customers might be willing to pay based on that.

* **Steps**:

  1. Determine the value your product adds (time saved, revenue increased, cost saved).
  2. Estimate how much of that value you can capture through pricing.
  3. Multiply by the number of target customers.

* **Example**:
  If your tool saves a business \$10,000/year and you're pricing at \$2,000/year, and there are 5,000 businesses, market size = \$10M.

* **Pros**: Useful for new or disruptive products.

* **Cons**: Assumes value perception aligns with pricing.

---

##### 4. **Comparables Approach**

Use similar businesses or products to estimate your own market size.

* **Steps**:

  1. Identify analog companies or markets.
  2. Adjust for differences in geography, market maturity, price points.

* **Example**:
  If a competitor has \$100M revenue in a market you‚Äôre entering and you're targeting 10% of their segment, your opportunity might be \$10M.

* **Pros**: Quick and practical.

* **Cons**: May overlook uniqueness of your product or market.

---

##### 5. **Customer Surveys and Primary Research**

Gather data directly from potential customers to estimate market size.

* **Steps**:

  1. Survey or interview potential buyers about willingness to pay and usage.
  2. Extrapolate to broader population.
* **Pros**: Customized, direct feedback.
* **Cons**: Costly, can have sample bias.

#### useful terms to talk about market sizing

**SOM** stands for **Serviceable Obtainable Market** ‚Äî it's the **portion of the market you can realistically capture**, considering your current resources, competition, and go-to-market strategy.

---

### Here's a breakdown of the related terms:

| Term                                    | Meaning                                                                    | Example (Fitness App)                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TAM** (Total Addressable Market)      | The total demand for your product/service, assuming no constraints.        | Entire U.S. fitness and wellness market (\~\$35B)                                           |
| **SAM** (Serviceable Available Market)  | The part of the TAM targeted by your product's features and geography.     | U.S. digital fitness app segment (\~\$3.5B)                                                 |
| **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market) | The part of the SAM that you can realistically capture in the near future. | Urban millennials who might actually use your app (\~\$30M‚Äì\$50M, depending on assumptions) |

---

**Think of it like this**:

* **TAM** = ‚ÄúIf everyone in the world who could use this, did.‚Äù
* **SAM** = ‚ÄúIf everyone in your target market did.‚Äù
* **SOM** = ‚ÄúWhat you could actually get.‚Äù

Market analysis/research sources:
- Google industry reports
- Look at websites that provide traffic data. Check what kind of traffic or app downloads your competitors are getting.

## Find the competitors

1. Known competitors:
   - based on your experience with the product and domain, you already know who your primary competitors are. Every product manager should know this. It is essential.
   - feature competitors: not all competitors have the same set of features. So, if your focus is on a feature of your product, for example, cedarling (a embedable, light weight PDP), then you need to know which of your competitors have features that solve the same problem.
2. Unknown competitors:
   - When you are building a new feature or a new product altogether. Also, for an existing product the competetors keep on changing (companies shutdown, new companies come up, existing competitors may change the direction) etc, you should periodically survey the current competition state.
  
### Looking for unknown competitors

- google search for `<your product name> versus`. And google will suggest most likely searches. with possible names. This is because people have searched for it. But this will only be helpful if your product is well known.
- You can do a chatgpt search
- search for what your product is e.g `embedable PDP`
- search reddit, twitter etc for what user issue your product solves. You may find users that are complaining about the same thing and other suggesting them products that solve that problem.
- check sites like below and look for alternatives of a product or product category.
  - https://www.gartner.com/peer-insights/home
  - https://www.g2.com
  - https://www.capterra.com/
 
  - 
### types of competitors

- Direct
  -  Products that solve the same problem as your product
  -  They solve the same problem in the same way
  -  They solve the same problem in the same way for the same set of market or geography
  -  Example: Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) is Gluu's direct competitor. RH-SSO is built on top of Keycloak which is OSS, just like Flex is built on top of Janssen Server.
  -  Action item for PM: Keep a close eye on roadmap of such products and feature releases of such products and company news. What features are being developed, released, how are they marketing their product, where are they marketing their product, their market share movements, leadership changes, acquisitions etc.
- Indirect
  -  Products that solve same problem but in a different way and may be for a different user market. Their market could be superset of yours or a subset or may be having a little bit of overlap.
  - Example:
  - Action item for PM: You shouldn't be losing too many customers to these competitors.
- Potential
  -  companies that have a product that solves a different problem but it is in the same domain as yours. They serve the same set of market (customer group). They could expand their portfolio and add a new product with competing features as your product and then they can potentially become a direct competetor.
  -  Example: `https://www.cerbos.dev/` is a company that provides authorization software. But they could potentially add authentication features and become a direct competetors.
  -  Action item for PM: Add features that these competitors can't add easily in your core domain area.
- Substitute
  - solves the same problem but doesn't deliver to the same people in the same way and it is far from what you are offering to the market.
  - For instance, gluu offers IAM software which is backed by a core team and an enterprise support plan. Substitute could be an opensource IAM repository in the GitHub which doesn't have any sponsor or a company backing it with an enterprise plan. Yes, it may provide the same function and large enterprises can use it as their IAM server but it is not the same as Gluu.
  - Action item for PM: Be better then these in solving the problem. Meaning feature parity perspective.

### what you should know about your competitors

- Need to closely monitor and watch your competetors. On following criterias.

  1. product core (product team):
     - better team can out pace you in feature delivery, out engineer you by building better and stable product. If you have a team with much lower quality than your competitor, then features and markets won't matter. Features that depend on high quality engineering are difficult to imitate by your competetors.
  2. user base size:
     - Companies with large user base(e.g microsoft) have certain advantages
       - New product and feature launches are easier get initial set of users. As existing customers would easily adopt those new features.
       - publicity: new products and new features from a company with large user base get more publicity quickly. Content creators and early adoptors start             immediately talking about those things.
     -  . Easier to make deals with other companies and have collaboration and integrations:
     - For a product with large userbase, other companies will readily agree to create integrations and collaborations
  3. Design
     - Be aware of competetor's ability to design an intuitive user experience.
  4. Brand
     - A company's brand can give them advantage in certain markets while it will be of disadvantage in other markets. Like for example, Sony as a brand can easily make and sell kitchen appliences if they wanted to. But Mercedese which is known only for cars will find it difficult to get into kitchen appliences market. Same thing with Sony, it'll hard to get into making cars.
     - At the same time, apple could move easily from making Phone to making watches. This is because their brand stands for inituitively designed and high quality consumer goods.
  5. Speed
       - Understand the speed at which your competetor can move to build a new feature in the product. Generally, larget companies are slower that smaller companies. In case of opensource products, you can check your competetor's GH account and see how long an new feature request takes to compete.

--------------------------
42
--------------------------------

feature tables:

- table where you compare your product with your competitor's. Mostly the direct competitors.
- It can also cover the factors(price, reliability etc) and not just features.

| feature table | compete 1 | compete 2 | compete 3 | You |
| ------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --- |
| feature 1 | compete 1 | compete 2 | compete 3 | You |

General notes

## Feature prioritization (roadmapping)

- Prioritization, roadmap, feature analysis
  - Feature analysis methods compared : RICE/ICE/MoSCoW : https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sachin-sharma-product-career-coach_projects-productmanagement-careercoach-activity-7322839576505372672-InQ_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAADcnXwB2SGQ3YB0J31qjo1zUTB5LqDuqag
  - Analysis methods list: https://www.productplan.com/learn/strategies-prioritize-product-features/
  - simple 2x2 technique of value vs effort analysis: https://mtp2017.wpenginepowered.com/enter-matrix-lean-prioritisation/
- One critical aspect in any prioritization/roadmap effort is to estimate business value of the feature. A feature's value can be derived by considering two factors:
  - Value offered to users: The value an initiative will deliver to your user personas or your market more broadly. This type of value would include, for example, the degree to which your initiative will reduce users‚Äô pain or improve their efficiency, and how urgently your market seems to be demanding it.
  - Value offered to the business: An estimation of the initiative‚Äôs direct business value to your company. This value might be reflected in terms of acquiring new customers, retaining existing customers, the ability to upsell customers, and the anticipated new revenue the initiative will bring.






----------------------------
Product design, UI, UX
----------------------------

- UX: UX is the experience that a person gets while using the product. Each person would feel(expereince) the same product differently based on what they value. A sports car's experience would be fantastic to a person who loves thrills and speed. While Same sports car would be experienced differently by someone who has been troumatized by a recent car accident. So, it is not the design of the car that is at fault. It is knowing what is the value that user is seeking from the product.
- How user experiences the product is also dependent on under what circumstances that product is being used. High pressure, leisure etc.
- Use 5-why technique to get some idea of what customer values about the product

product analytics
------------------------

Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-Igkw7__z0

Product analytics: 

product lifecycle: discovery, delivery, distribution

Metrics: Any thing that you can measure about your product. KPIs are metrics that are important.

Few well known metrics:

Revenue,
MRR : monthly recurring revenue (imp for SaaS)
ARPU: average revenue per user
DAU: Daily active users

Metric tree: 

For SaaS companies like Zoho:

```
Revenue = MRR x 12
           |
           |
           Active users x ARPU
                |          
          New users        
          +                
          Old users(Active users last month - churn rate(ie users who left your system)
```
