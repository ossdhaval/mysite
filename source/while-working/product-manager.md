Four stages of product lifecycle. 

- introduction
  - Company has just introduced a new product. Need and the market for the product is still not proven
  - Only early adoptors are buying the product, so product is lossing money at this time due to little or no revenue
  - There are almost no or very few competitors in the market
- growth
  -  Products need and market has been proven to exist and consumers have accepted the product
  -  Wider base of consumers are quickly buying the product. Product sees a rapid growth in revenue month on month or year on year. Revenue growth is a good indicator of product being in the growth phase.
  -  Product starts to see new competition in the market with other players introducing similar products
- maturity
  - product revenue peaks. The market is mature with lot of competitors. 
- decline
  - product revenue declines. Products can be phased out at this point, or relaunched with new features etc. Strategy may vary.
