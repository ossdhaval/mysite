You can explicitly declare a managed bean by annotating the bean class @ManagedBean, but in CDI you don\u2019t need to. According to the specification, the CDI container treats any class that satisfies the following conditions as a managed bean:</p> <ul> <li>It is not a non-static inner class.</li> <li>It is a concrete class, or is annotated @Decorator.</li> <li>It is not annotated with an EJB component-defining annotation or declared as an EJB bean class in ejb-jar.xml.</li> <li>It does not implement javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Extension.</li> <li>It has an appropriate constructor\u2014either:</li> <li>the class has a constructor with no parameters, or</li> <li>the class declares a constructor annotated @Inject.</li> </ul> <p>Bean types for a managed bean contains the bean class, every superclass and all interfaces it implements directly or indirectly.</p> <p>If a managed bean has a public field, it must have the default scope @Dependent</p> <ul> <li> <p>@Inject may be applied to a constructor or method of a bean, and tells the container to call that constructor or method when instantiating the bean. The container will inject other beans into the parameters of the constructor or method.</p> </li> <li> <p>Notice the controller bean is request-scoped and named (<code>@Named @RequestScoped</code>). Since this combination is so common in web applications, there\u2019s a built-in annotation for it in CDI that we could have used as a shorthand. When the (stereotype) annotation <code>@Model</code> is declared on a class, it creates a request-scoped and named bean. Alternatively, we may obtain an instance of TextTranslator programmatically from an injected instance of Instance, parameterized with the bean type: <code>@Inject Instance&lt;TextTranslator&gt; textTranslatorInstance;</code></p> </li> <li> <p>it isn\u2019t necessary to create a getter or setter method to inject one bean into another. CDI can access an injected field directly (even if it\u2019s private!), which sometimes helps eliminate some wasteful code. The name of the field is arbitrary. It\u2019s the field\u2019s type that determines what is injected.</p> </li> <li> <p>At system initialization time, the container must validate that exactly one bean exists which satisfies each injection point. In our example, if no implementation of Translator is available\u2014if the SentenceTranslator EJB was not deployed\u2014the container would inform us of an unsatisfied dependency.

You declare the name of each type of principal, resource, and action that your application supports. The definition of those entities can also include a list of the attributes that define an entity of that type, with each attribute specifying a name and a data type. Schema is not a must but it can help you make policy evaluations less error prone. </p> <p>A schema is defined by using JSON. Schemas have three main properties:</p> <ul> <li>Namespace: uniquely identifies the schema. The namespace helps you distinguish between elements with the same name from multiple schemas, for example HRApp::File and MedicalRecordsApp::File. The namespace is expressed as the top level key of the schema. Within each namespace, there is a JSON object defining entityTypes, actions, and types.</li> <li>entityTypes: defines the principal types and resource types supported by your application. Each entity type defines a shape that describes its characteristics. The shape must specify a Cedar supported data type, and define the structure for the more complex types like records or sets. The entity can also specify an optional memberOf attribute to describe how this type can participate in a hierarchy, like files can be in folders, users can be members of groups, or photos can be organized in albums. Note that if you specify that an entity can be a member of its own type, then you are specifying that you can nest them, such as placing folders in other folders.</li> <li>actions: defines the operations that the principals can potentially perform on the resources. Each action defines a name for the action, and a list of the resources and principals to which the action can apply.</li> <li>commonTypes: defines type aliases for complex record types in the schema.

Sender sends (message+signature) to receiver. - Receiver: Signature verification is basically the process of decrypting the hash using public key of the sender(this means message is coming from the authentic source).  - Receiver: Message verification is process of matching this hash with the locally derived hash of the message content. If the has match then the message has not been  tempered with. - Digital signing is the process of generating a unique proof (signature) that a specific person/entity created a message and that the message has not been altered.</p> <p>In above, it is most important for the receiver to have the public key of the sender from a trusted source. In case of WEB, the web-browser(receiver) receives the public key of the sender through the x.509 certificate that the sender shares. </p> <p>x.509 certificate is nothing but public key of the sender, with signature of the CA. Again, to ensure that the public key is authentic, and not tempered with, the browser has to use CA authority's public key to decrypt the CA's signature in the x.509 certificate. </p> <p>Browsers come pre-populated with public keys of the world's most of the trusted CAs. So, browser already has the a public key of the CA. </p> <p>So here is the sequence.</p> <ul> <li>Sender creates it's own private and public key pair</li> <li>It keeps the private key with itself and gives public key along with other details (company name, domain name for which the cert is required, phone number etc)   to the CA when requesting for an x.509 certificate</li> <li>CA does the background check to verify if the company and the domain are legitimate, and then issues an x.509 certificate. Most important part   of the certificate is the public key of the sender and signature of CA. Certificate content looks similar   to below.</li> </ul> <p><pre><code>Certificate:\n  Data:\n      Version: 3 (0x2)\n      Serial Number:\n          04:93:2a:1e:bd:77:f3:b1:8c:15:d2:30:11:8c:0f:ac:cc:7b\n  Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption\n      Issuer: C = US, O = Let's Encrypt, CN = R3\n      Validity\n          Not Before: Jun  1 00:00:00 2024 GMT\n          Not After : Aug 30 23:59:59 2024 GMT\n      Subject: CN = www.example.com\n      Subject Public Key Info:\n          Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n              RSA Public-Key: (2048 bit)\n              Modulus:\n                  00:b5:af:3b:dc:...:3f:7b\n              Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n      X509v3 extensions:\n          X509v3 Basic Constraints:\n              CA:FALSE\n          X509v3 Key Usage:\n              Digital Signature, Key Encipherment\n          X509v3 Extended Key Usage:\n              TLS Web Server Authentication\n          X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:\n              DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com\n  Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption\n       a4:5c:cd:3e:...:b6\n</code></pre>   - Sender stores this certificate along with the corresponding private key of it's web server.   - When any browser requests a web page over HTTPS, a TLS handshake occures before serving the page.   - In TLS handshake,     - Browser requests the x.509 certificate of the domain     - server sends the certificate. Certificate has the name of the certificate issuer.     - The browser looks up its pre-loaded CA database. If it finds the CAs public key there, then it uses the public key to       verify the x.509's authenticity by decrypting the signature and obtaining the hash. Then it hashes the public key of the       sender contained in the certificate to create the hash. If these two hashes match then the certificate is authentic and       public key of the sender as mentioned in the certificate is also correct.     - Now, browser has the authentic public key of the server. Next, the browser creates a random number to be used as a session key. Encrypts it using       the server's public key. Sends the encrypted session key to the server. Server uses it's the private key to decrypt the session key.     - Session key is then used to encrypt all future communication between browser and server during that session.</p> <p>======= more info ==========================================</p> <p>\ud83d\udd04 The Two Main Steps \ud83d\udd8a\ufe0f 1.

We might introduce an Ops Toggle when rolling out a new feature which has unclear performance implications so that system operators can disable or degrade that feature quickly in production if needed. <code>kill switches</code> can be long lived which will allow support teams to disable few heavy features in case of heavy traffic.</li> <li> <p>Permissioning Toggles: These flags are used to change the features or product experience that certain users receive. For example we may have a set of \"premium\" features which we only toggle on for our paying customers. Or perhaps we have a set of \"alpha\" features which are only available to internal users and another set of \"beta\" features which are only available to internal users plus beta users.</p> <ul> <li>can be very long lived ( multi-year) in cases where we are controlling premium features for paid customers</li> <li>effect is very dynamic as each user request may be treated differently</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Manage different toggles differently:</p> </li> <li>These differences should be embraced, and different toggles managed in different ways, even if all the various toggles might be controlled using the same technical machinery. Initially we might have placed that section behind a Release Toggle while it was under development. We might then have moved it to being behind an Experiment Toggle to validate that it was helping drive revenue. Finally we might move it behind an Ops Toggle so that we can turn it off when we're under extreme load. If we've followed the earlier advice around de-coupling decision logic from Toggle Points then these differences in toggle category should have had no impact on the Toggle Point code at all. However from a feature flag management perspective these transitions absolutely should have an impact. As part of transitioning from Release Toggle to an Experiment Toggle the way the toggle is configured will change, and likely move to a different area - perhaps into an Admin UI rather than a yaml file in source control. Product folks will likely now manage the configuration rather than developers. Likewise, the transition from Experiment Toggle to Ops Toggle will mean another change in how the toggle is configured, where that configuration lives, and who manages the configuration.</li> </ul> <p>Other good links: - https://dzone.com/articles/feature-toggles-are-one-worst - https://www.abhishek-tiwari.com/decoupling-deployment-and-release-feature-toggles/</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/ff4j-notes/#about-ff4j","title":"about ff4j","text":""},{"location":"while-coding/ff4j-notes/#features","title":"features","text":"<ul> <li>feature store: For distributed architecture, <code>feature store</code> works as central repo for all feature toggles which all the microservices can refer.</li> <li>permission based feature toggles: </li> <li> <p>conditional feature toggles:</p> </li> <li> <p>FF4J works using strategies.You can create your own strategies too.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"while-coding/ff4j-notes/#code-and-design","title":"code and design","text":"<ul> <li>two main classes <code>WebAPIController</code> and <code>*Provider</code></li> <li><code>provider</code> has single overridden method <code>getFF4j</code> which provides <code>FF4J</code> object.<ul> <li><code>FF4J</code> object has xml where features details are given, datasource connection details, propertystore, featurestore and eventstore instances with datasource given as argument.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>WebAPIController</code> has single method <code>getWebApiConfiguration</code> that returns <code>apiconfig</code> object.

Which means they are tracking a remote branch. You can see which local tracking branch is tracking which remote branch, you can do it with \n</code></pre> git branch -vv  <pre><code>### local branches, remote tracked branches, branches on remote server\n\n In git, code can reside on your local machine or some remote server. Both local machine and remote can have branches that other one don't know about. Branch that is in local machine is called 'local branch', branch that is in remote server is called 'remote branch'. Git also maintains remote-tracking branches on your local machines for every remote that you have. This is essentially download of all the branches and code that was on remote server when you connected with it last time using `fetch` (or `pull`).\n\nNow, you can link-up your local branch to a remote tracking branch for ease of use. If you do, git automatically knows which remote branch a local branch pushes to or fetches from. If you want to see which of your local branches are linked to which remote-tracking branches, you can use\n\n ```\n git branch -vv\n ```\n\nif you want to see complete list of branches on the remote (i.e github) for this repo:\n</code></pre> git branch -r <pre><code> #### About local branches\n\n ##### first option of using untracked local branch\n\n - you can create a simple local branch that doesn't link to any remote tracker using `git branch &lt;name&gt;`\n   - Remember that changes in the current branch that you haven't committed yet will also be part of new branch\n - Start using this branch by switching to it: `git switch &lt;name&gt;`\n - Remember, even if your local branch is not tracking a remote tracking branch, you can still use it to work with any remote branch. It is just that you have to mention which remote and which branch of that remote should be used for that operation everytime. I recommend this manual approach as it makes it clear where your code is going and coming.\n - To make local branch track a remote branch: `git branch -u &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt; &lt;local-branch&gt;`\n\n ##### second option of using tracked local branch\n\n benefit of this approach is that you know later \n\n - `git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;`\n - `git push --set-upstream origin &lt;new-branch-name&gt;`\n - Now if you do `git branch -vv` you'll see that local branch is tracking the remote branch. \n - run `git fetch -p`. After this remote branch is deleted (after merge) you'll see that `git branch -vv` mentions `gone` against the remote branch. This was you know that local branch is no longer useful and delete it. In the first option above, it is hard to find out whether a local branch has been delivered and not longer usefu. So it is hard to delete it for cleanup.\n\n\n\n### create branch localy and push it to github\n\n`git checkout -b 'feature-1'` - Create and switch to new branch\n</code></pre>  git branch --set-upstream-to origin/feature-1  git push  <pre><code>Above sets remote tracking branch for current branch\n\n or you can do \n</code></pre>  git push origin feature-1:feature-1 <pre><code> above will create a new branch on remote 'origin' and push changes of local branch to that branch\n</code></pre></p> <p>dhaval@thinkpad:~/IdeaProjects/ossdhaval/github-action-check$ git checkout -b 'feature-1' Switched to a new branch 'feature-1' dhaval@thinkpad:~/IdeaProjects/ossdhaval/github-action-check$ git status On branch feature-1 nothing to commit, working tree clean dhaval@thinkpad:~/IdeaProjects/ossdhaval/github-action-check$ git push origin fatal: The current branch feature-1 has no upstream branch.

Which means take my *master* branch and push it to *origin*'s master branch. Using this you can also push changes in your master branch to some other branch on remote.\n\n\n#### How to know which branches can be deleted?\n\n\n\n1. Look at `git branch -vv`\n\n Above will list all the branches with it's remote tracking branches. If you see the `gone` mentioned along side of the remote branch, that it may be a case were the branch was merged using a PR and then workflow has deleted the remote branch on GH. Local Branches where remote branches are `gone` can be deleted.\n\n2. To further confirm whether the most lastest commit on the local branch have been added to main, you can search the main branch using command below for the commit message of the last commit on the local branch.\n\n `git log main --grep=\"fix: add missing README files`\n\n\n#### How to completely remove local branch and remote-tracking branch and start fresh from remote branch:\n\nIn case you have messy code in your local branch that you have committed but not pushed to remote. You want to get rid of this code and start afresh from remote branch. For this you have to \n\n 1. Delete local branch: `git branch -D file-sync-22-master-1623760119`. Check using `git branch -vv`\n 2. Delete local remote-tracking branch: `git branch -dr origin/file-sync-22-master-1623760119`. Check using `git remote show &lt;remote-name&gt;`\n 3. Get remote branch in local tracker branch again: `git pull`. Check using `git remote show &lt;remote-name&gt;`\n 4. Create new local branch from newly created local remote-tracking branch: `git checkout -b file-sync-22-master-1623760119 origin/file-sync-22-master-1623760119`. Check using `git branch -vv`.\n\n `ref:` https://stackoverflow.com/a/23961231/2331225\n\n\n## Ignoring files\n\nThere are three ways to which files should git ignore:\n\n- using `.gitignore` file in your repo : best way to share with other developers who use the same repo\n- using `$LOCAL_REPO_DIR/info/exclude`: use this when you want to ignore files and don't want to commit to the repo. But this `exclude` file is repository-specific\n- using `core.excludesFile` global ignore files: best way to ignore ide-specific or user-specific files in the local workspace **that need to be applied to all the local git repositories**\n  - create a text file anywhere and list the files which you want to ignore. For example, if you want to ignore `.vscode` directory, put the content below in the file.\n    ```\n    .vscode\n    ```\n  - run the command below to make a settings entry in your global git config file which is usually at your home directory `~/.gitconfig`\n    ```\n    git config --global core.excludesFile '~/code/personal-configs/git-global-ignore-settings'\n    ```\n  - after this `.vscode` directory will be ignored everywhere in all your repositories on this machine\n\n### About git ignore:\n\n- git ignore doesn't have a command. It is only controlled by patterns mentioned in the files.\n- There are two files that you can edit. Below is except from [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)\n  ```\n  Which file to place a pattern in depends on how the pattern is meant to be used.\n\n  Patterns which should be version-controlled and distributed to other repositories\n  via clone (i.e., files that all developers will want to ignore) should go into a .gitignore file.\n  Meaning, these are files created by your project itself and should be ignored by every developer\n  who is using this codebase.\n\n  Patterns which are specific to a particular repository but which do not need to be shared with other\n  related repositories (e.g., IDE specific files like `.vscode` etc) should go into the $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file.\n  ```\n\nAvoiding to use .gitignore for your custom file :\n\nIn a large project, everyone shares the same gitignore file which is commited and maintained in repository just like any other common code file. I you want to add few custom ignores to this file, it'll affect everyone. To avoid this, use below :\n\nhttps://medium.com/@dave_lunny/exclude-files-from-git-without-committing-changes-to-gitignore-986fa712e78d\n\n\nMy co-worker pointed me to the .git/info/exclude file which, much like a .gitignore file, allows you to ignore files from being staged. This keeps things nice and clean, and the best part is that you don\u2019t commit anything in the .git/ directory, so it\u2019s like your own personal .gitignore that no one else can see or touch!\n\ngitignore general guidlines :\n\nSetting up a .gitignore file for your new repository before you get going is generally a good idea so you don\u2019t accidentally commit files that you really don\u2019t want in your Git repository\n\nIn the simple case, a repository might have a single .gitignore file in its root directory, which applies recursively to the entire repository. However, it is also possible to have additional .gitignore files in subdirectories. The rules in these nested .gitignore files apply only to the files under the directory where they are located.\n\nGitHub maintains a fairly comprehensive list of good .gitignore file examples for dozens of projects and languages at https://github.com/github/gitignore if you want a starting point for your project.\n\nsome useful patterns :\n\n### ignore all .a files\n*.a\n\n### but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above\n!lib.a\n\n### only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO\n/TODO\n\n### ignore all files in any directory named build\nbuild/\n\n### ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt\ndoc/*.txt\n\n### ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories\ndoc/**/*.pdf\n\nHow to see what changes have you made to files and are not staged or staged but are not commited :\n\ngit diff\n\nTo see what you\u2019ve changed but not yet staged, type git diff with no other arguments\n\nIf you want to see what you\u2019ve staged that will go into your next commit, you can use git diff --staged. This command compares your staged changes to your last commit\n\n\n\nTo push your changes to remote repo :\ngit push remote-name branch-name\nexample: git push origin master\nthis will ask for github username and password. \n\nGuidlines for git commit messages from PRO-git:\n\nThe last thing to keep in mind is the commit message. Getting in the habit of creating quality\ncommit messages makes using and collaborating with Git a lot easier. As a general rule, your\n129messages should start with a single line that\u2019s no more than about 50 characters and that describes\nthe changeset concisely, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed explanation. The Git\nproject requires that the more detailed explanation include your motivation for the change and\ncontrast its implementation with previous behavior \u2014 this is a good guideline to follow. Write your\ncommit message in the imperative: \"Fix bug\" and not \"Fixed bug\" or \"Fixes bug.\"\n\nMore guidelines for commit messages:\n https://robertcooper.me/post/git-commit-messages\n\n### How to troubleshoot : 'Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged' problem.\n\nthis is because the your branch has commits that are not built on top of commits currently available in same branch on origin(remote).  i.e : master branch in your local repo vs master branch in remote repo.\n\nhead(master)    : commit1, commit2, commit3, commit5\n\norigin(master)  : commit1, commit2, commit3, commit4\n\nIt may be because while you were working on code changes for commit5 in your local repo and committed to local repo, the remote branch moved on due to somebody else pushed changes in it. \nAt this point, if you do a 'git status', you get above message.\n\ndhaval@dhaval-Lenovo-U41-70:~/code/eclipse-workspace/gsg-event-service$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,\nand have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.\n  (use \"git pull\" to merge the remote branch into yours)\n\nNow there are two solutions when you have to synch up two branches: rebase or merge.\n\nIn this case, we want to synch up with same branch on remote server. \n\n Since merge creates a non-linear history, rebase is preferred by many. \nrebase essentially brings in commit5 from remote into your local repo and then puts back commit4 on top of that. \n\nTo use this option :\n</code></pre> git pull --rebase <pre><code> See the https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2452226/master-branch-and-origin-master-have-diverged-how-to-undiverge-branches/2452610\n\n\n\n### synching your local feature branch with main (or some other branch)\n\n Here you have two options like in above case: rebase or merge\n\n In above case we were getting latest commits from remote of same branch, but in here, we want to get latest commits from main branch and make our branch latest.\n\n - If your feature branch is public (i.e pushed to github) then use merge as merge doesn't change SHA of existing commits but creates a new merge commit (to avoid this, many people use rebase as below)\n</code></pre>  git switch main  git pull  git switch feature  git merge main <pre><code> - if your feature branch is still only on your local then use rebase as rebase creates a linear history by getting commits from main to your branch (keeping the SHA same) and then recreating your commits on top of those (SHA changes for your commits).

For example : I was working on a project where first I tried to integrate with RDBMS using JPA. All these changes were pushed to B1. Then I started to make changes on my local to integrate with DynamoDB instead of RDBMS. But that didn't go well. So, Now I wanted to go back to last commited changes on B1 without loosing my DynamoDB changes. So I decided that I'll create a new branch and store DynamoDB changes on a that branch. And then again switch back to B1 and continue working on RDBMS. Below is the sequence of commands that helped.\n</code></pre> git branch NoSQL git checkout NoSQL <pre><code>now you'll see that master, NoSQL and origin/master are on the same commit using 'git log'\n\ncommit 009ed95a6d83e5b899b5c864a8b84bf72cbb4740 (HEAD -&gt; NoSQL, origin/master, master)\n</code></pre> git status <p>git add .</p> <p>git commit -m 'Initial attempt at sing DynamoDB'</p> <p>git push origin NoSQL</p> <p>git checkout master <pre><code>In case you have made direct changes in your code from github ( or someone else has committed changes in the branch ) and you want to make your local branch updated with those changes then :\ngit checkout\nYour branch is behind 'origin/dhaval-development' by 40 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.\n  (use \"git pull\" to update your local branch)\ngit pull\nUsername for 'https://github.com': ossdhaval\nPassword for 'https://ossdhaval@github.com': \nUpdating 17e6c35..579473e\nFast-forward\n Jenkinsfile  | 24 ++++++++++++++++++++++++\n package.json |  9 +++------\n 2 files changed, 27 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)\n create mode 100644 Jenkinsfile\n\n\n`git fetch &lt;remote&gt;` brings all data about that remote to your local machine, including references of new branches that are created on remote server by others.\n\n`git fetch &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;` brings data from remote only about a particular branch.\n\n### Using git fetch and merge instead of pull:\n\nWhile the `git fetch &lt;remote&gt;` command will fetch all the changes on the server that you don\u2019t have yet, it will\nnot modify your working directory at all. It will simply get the data for you and let you merge it\nyourself. However, there is a command called git pull which is essentially a git fetch immediately\nfollowed by a git merge in most cases.\n\nGenerally it\u2019s better to simply use the fetch and merge commands explicitly as the magic of git pull\ncan often be confusing.\n\nSecondly, Suppose there is a branch called `serverfix` on remote server that you don't have.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that when you do a fetch that brings down new remote-tracking branches, you don\u2019t automatically have local, editable copies of them. In other words, in this case, you don\u2019t have a new serverfix branch\u2009\u2014\u2009you have only an origin/serverfix pointer that you can\u2019t modify.\n\nTo merge this work into your current working branch, you can run git merge origin/serverfix. If you want your own serverfix branch that you can work on, you can base it off your remote-tracking branch:\n</code></pre> $ git checkout -b serverfix origin/serverfix Branch serverfix set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin. Switched to a new branch 'serverfix' <pre><code>This gives you a local branch that you can work on that starts where origin/serverfix is.\n\n\n\n#### Workflow for Contributing to an opensource project :\n\ncreate a fork\n\nclone that fork in your local machine\n\nthen make sure you have this setup so that your fork is updated: \nhttps://gist.github.com/CristinaSolana/1885435 or\nhttps://stefanbauer.me/articles/how-to-keep-your-git-fork-up-to-date\n\n#### To view files in some other branch without switching from your branch\n\nSyntax:\n</code></pre> git show branch-name:relative-path-of-file <pre><code>Example:\n</code></pre> git show pull-request-decoration:.github/workflows/build-with-coverage.yml</p> <pre><code>#### To store credentials for 18 hours:\n</code></pre> <p>git config --global credential.helper \"cache --timeout 64800\"</p> <p><pre><code>#### add description to your commit using command line.\n\n When you fire `git commit` without a `-m`, git will open an editor within terminal. You can put your commit title and description in there. \n - `git commit` ( or you can continue to use other flags as well like `git commit -S -a` )\n - opens an editor\n - put your commit title after first few commented lines.\n - leave a line blank and then put your description\n - `ctrl+o`\n - enter\n - `ctrl+x\n\n#### resolving git merge conflicts:\n\nIf you are trying to pull some changes and merge conflicts happen then you have two choices:\n 1) use commandline to merge using `git merge -t vimdiff`. This will open vimdiff on the terminal and show merge conflicts that you have merge. But this is little\n difficult as it is difficult to navigate commandline.\n 2) use Intellij's merge conflict tool. To use it:\n  - Press `shift+shift` and then search for 'conflict'. You should see a tool in `git` category.\n  - open this tool and then using it you should be easily able to merge. It shows three files.\n    - Left: is your local changes\n    - Right: is incoming changes\n    - Center: is will be the final outcome. This is what you have to edit.\n  - Once completed, click apply to apply the changes. \n  - now if you go and fire `git status` then you'll see that your local copy has been modified. You can commit that.\n\n ### cherry picking:\n\nA cherry-pick in Git is like a rebase for a single commit. It takes the patch that was introduced in a commit\nand tries to reapply it on the branch you\u2019re currently on. This is useful if you have a number of\ncommits on a topic branch and you want to integrate only one of them, or if you only have one\ncommit on a topic branch and you\u2019d prefer to cherry-pick it rather than run rebase.\n\nremember that when cherry picking, you don't have to mention the source-branch. Just mention the commit sha.\n\nBy default cherry pick will bring in the changes from source commit and commit them to your branch. See the command below. (you can use -n option if you don't want to commit the incoming changes. Then it'll just stage those changes, which you can edit and manually merge. This is very useful)\n</code></pre>  $ git cherry-pick -S e43a6 Finished one cherry-pick.

Notice the `^` character at the end of first commit. This is to indicate to git to include that commit as well in cherry pick:\n\n ```\n git cherry-pick -S dc99f87656a952f3548c320c6459278876f9f7b7^..6967cfc4751c87579c563ba9cbb3721116b72be0\n ```\n\n if your cherry pick gets a merge conflict, it'll show message as below\n</code></pre> Auto-merging CONTRIBUTING.md CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in CONTRIBUTING.md error: could not apply 2e158b7... docs: update triage section details hint: after resolving the conflicts, mark the corrected paths hint: with 'git add ' or 'git rm ' hint: and commit the result with 'git commit' <pre><code>You can edit conflicted file and resolve the conflict, run `git add` to add that file and then `git commit` to commit that file. But, cherry pick would stop when it finds a conflict and doesn't pick rest of the commits in the range. So, you have to again start cherry pick from where it left. But first you have to stop the previous cherry pick by `git cherry-pick --quit` and then git another cherry pick command with remaining commits as range.\n\n Now you can remove your topic branch and drop the commits you didn\u2019t want to pull in.\n\n &gt; Note: when you cherry-pick a commit, git essentially generates a new commit. And if the original commit had a signature (using -S), then new commit **will not** have that signature. If you want to add signature to new commit as well, use `-S` with cherry-pick as well.\n\n  ```\n git cherry-pick -S 2493781^..c5e9df3\n ```\n\n\n\n ### What to do when you have unsigned commits in your PR\n\n\n\n### Reset a branch to be same as remote branch\n\n ```\n git reset --hard origin/&lt;branch-name&gt;\n ```\n\n### using sparse checkout to just check out one directory from monorepo\n</code></pre> 4581  02/02/22 11:24:08 mkdir jans-evelen 4582  02/02/22 11:24:15 cd jans-evelen/ 4583  02/02/22 11:24:20 git init 4584  02/02/22 11:24:37 git sparse-checkout init --cone 4585  02/02/22 11:25:05 git sparse-checkout set jans-eleven 4586  02/02/22 11:25:25 git remote add origin git@github.com:JanssenProject/jans.git 4587  02/02/22 11:26:08 git pull origin main <pre><code>### (not recommended) how to sign commits that you have already pushed to Github\n\n#### Recommended\n\n - One way which is not recommended is to amend the commits and force push. But this will rewrite the history. So, not suggestable.\n - Second approach is to create a new branch, cherry-pick all commits of the old branch to new branch and sign them in the process\n - create a new PR for merging and close old PR without merging\n - Above steps in more details\n - go to intellij and switch to `main`\n - git pull\n - git branch new-branch\n - git switch new-branch\n - git cherry-pick -S 2493781^..c5e9df3 (here the first commit sha is taken from first commit of the old PR and the second sha is last commit)\n - push this branch and create a new PR\n - close old PR\n\n#### Not recommended (uses force push) \n\n Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13043357/git-sign-off-previous-commits\n\n Remember that commit number will change when you do this. So, you'll have to force push to github.\n\n `git rebase --signoff -S HEAD~3` : this will add PGP sign and `signed-off by` message to last three commits\n\n `git rebase --signoff -S &lt;SHA&gt;` : this is for one particular commit \n\n after this do `git push --force-with-lease` to push out changes. But one thing that I noticed is that in the PR I could still see previous unsigned commits. I expected those commits to be overwritten.\n\n\n ### why to avoid force push \n https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/force-with-lease/\n\n### git revert\n\n### git clean \n\nremove all the untracked files from repo\n</code></pre> git clean -f <pre><code>remove all untracked, ignored files plus directories. \n</code></pre> git clean -dxf <pre><code>### rewriting a commit message\n\n Commit message is part of commit itself, so when you change the message, the commit sha changes. It is like you are creating new commit and replacing old one. \n\n - if commit has not been pushed: `git commit --amend`\n - If commit has been pushed to remote(GH): Since old commit has already been pushed, you'll have to force push new commit which is a bad practise. So, in this case, you better create a new branch and new PR with good commit. Close the old PR without merging.\n Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message\n\n ### check commit signatures \n\n ```\n git log --show-signature\n ```\n\n ### How to create commit without any code change (empty commit)\n\n ```\n git commit --allow-empty -S -m 'docs: no changes required'\n ```\n\n ### Stash\n\n To stash whatever you have now (tracked + untracked)\n\n ```\n git stash push -u -m 'my stash message'\n ```\n\n To get the last stash reapplied (`--index` will stage the files again which were previously staged)\n\n ```\n git stash apply --index\n ```\n\n List all awailable stashes:\n\n ```\n git stash list\n ```\n\n See contents of a particular stash:\n\n ```\n git stash show stash@{0}\n ```\n\n Delete or drop a stash\n\n ```\n git stash drop stash@{0}\n ```\n\n Apply stash by name\n\n ```\n git stash apply stash^{/my_stash_name}\n ```\n\n ### apply signature to commit automatically\n\n Use below command as one-time setting \n\n ```\n git config --global commit.gpgsign true\n ```\n\n Due to this\n - all commits will be signed automatically, like what `git commit -S` command does manually. You can ignore `-S` now\n - if you cherry-pick a commit, all commits are newly created. In this case, commits will be auto signed\n - if you `rebase` any thing, all commits are newly created. In this case, commits will be auto signed\n\n### mentioning someone else as author in a commit\n\n ```\n git commit --author=\"temp-ossdhaval\" -S -m 'message'\n ```\n\n ### difference between GPG sign a commit (-S) vs adding Sign-off (-s)\n\n - GPG signing is done by adding -S to commit command. Using this GH can verifies only the intended dev is making the commit.\n - `sign off by` is added by `-s`. It is up to the organisation how to interprete the sign off given by the developer.\n - in intellij you can configure signing of every commit with gpg using alt+ctrl+s -&gt; search git -&gt; click configure GPG -&gt; check mark on `sign all commits`\n - sign-off can be done by clicking `commit options` on the commit tool window that can open using `ctrl+0`\n\n ### Detached head state\n\n - HEAD is a file in git that points to the current branch normally\n - sometimes HEAD can also contain a SHA value of a commit. This is `detached HEAD` state. This happens when you checkout a particular commit, a tag, a PR, or a remote branch without fetching it first. \n\n ### Branch vs Tag\n\n - Branch is a reference to a commit and that reference changes when next commit is made\n - Tag is also a reference to a commit and it will **not** move if new commits are made\n\n ### How to know if there are any conflicts between two branches\n\n - Before raising a PR for your feature branch, if you want to know if PR will get merge conflict with base branch(let's say main) or not, then do this locally on your system:\n</code></pre>  # make sure you are on feature branch  git switch feature-branch <p># create temp branch from your feature branch  git checkout -b temp-feature-branch</p> <p># merge main  git merge main</p> <p># this will give you output as below.

'mvn install' is a asking maven to run install phase. 'mvn archetype:generate' is asking maven to run generate goal within archetype plugin.</p> <p>Plugin goals are independent and they can be invoked individually. While lifecycle phases are hierarchical. When you ask maven to do 'mvn install', maven is going to run all lifecycle phases before 'install' which are 'prepare-resource, compile, test, package'.</p> <p>Plugin goals are actual code while lifecycle phases are logical. Maven internally calls a goal of a plugin to execute that lifecycle phase. It also has a default mapping of these phases to plugin goals ( compile phase maps to 'compiler:compiler', test maps to 'surefire:test', package maps to 'jar:jar' ). So, when you say 'mvn install', it is going to invoke lifecycle phases ( a.k.a plugin goals ) one after other.</p> <p>One tricky thing here : lifecycle phase to plugin goal is not one way binding. Its two way binding where goals also specify what lifecycle phase they attach to. In this case, if you run a goal, maven will invoke all phases ( and associated goals to those phases ) before running actual goal. For example : code of surefire:test plugin mentions that it is a test phase goal. So, whether you run 'mvn test' or 'mvn surefire:test' it'll have same effect. All goals attached to preceding phases will be executed in both cases..</p> <p>One more tricky thing : There can be phases that don't have any goal attached. And there can be goals that are not associated with any phase.</p> <p>it is not that there is single lifecycle phase hierarchy. There are different hierarchies for different packaging. So, what you specify in  tag will control what lifecycle phase hierarchy is invoked. So, packaging determines which one of default hierarchies are invoked, hierarchy has phases. Again based on packaging specified, maven may attach different goal to same phase. For example : 'package' phase will be attached to jar:jar if packaging is mentioned as jar. But for 'war' packaging, maven will attach 'package' phase with war:war. In all, based on packaging, maven will determine hierarchy and goals attached to phases. <p>For further reference : http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Built-in_Lifecycle_Bindings</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/maven-notes/#simplest-parent-pom","title":"Simplest parent POM :","text":"<p>take pom of a quickstart project and create a copy of it.

But this doesn't happen. Why I don't know. I faced it and also see here. <code>Actual maven behaviour seems to be that that one profile can override modules on if they are defined in another profile.</code> So the solution is that you remove modules from POM's <code>&lt;project&gt;</code> and create a profile that loads by default that lists superset of modules, then you also should have another profile that lists subset of modules that you want to run. Now, when you run <code>mvn</code> by mentioning name of profile with subset, the default profile will not load. Hence only subset mentioned in your profile will be taken into account.</p> <p>Another maven behaviour which is documented but not very much known is that default profile mentioned in POM xml using <code>&lt;activeByDefault&gt;true&lt;/activeByDefault&gt;</code> will only be activated if there are no other profiles getting activated at the time of build. So, it is either the default profile or other profiles that get active. Most multimodule projects run with multiple profiles active at a time, hence default profiles are not very useful in multimodule projects. And due to this behaviour, the above solution of deactivating cetain modules using profiles also not usable.

Most importantly have labels for each component. Like <code>comp-componentname</code>. You will apply this labels to issues and PRs as you move them from respective repository to monorepo. In absence of these labels, issues/prs will be lumped together at the repo-level.

They say in the old repo which will be archived. And commits have been already merged so commits will move.   - Open PRs basically represent code which is not yet merged in trunk. Code is still in the feature branches. There are two ways get this code over to new repo     - Copy over       - In this approach, we ask PR owner to          - clone new monorepo         - create a new branch from the trunk of the monorepo (name prefixed with <code>modulename-</code>)         - then copy over files with code changes to new branch         - push the new branch         - create new PR.       - Basically, we are not moving PR here. We are just copying the code. Easiest and least error prone approach.      - Rebase branch       - In this approach, we ask PR owner to          - add monorepo as a new remote         - create a new branch from the trunk of the monorepo (name prefixed with <code>modulename-</code>)         - rebase you current branch with changes on this new branch         - push and create new PR       - In this approach, we maintain the commit history. More complex than <code>copy over</code> approach.   - In either approach, we had following points as checklist for PR owners:     - branch name should have component name as prefix, like <code>modulename-</code>     - commits should be signed     - use convensional commits     - link new PR to old PR     - Apply appropriate component label <code>comp-</code></p> <ul> <li>Useful points when working with Monorepo</li> <li>Sparse checkouts: https://github.blog/2020-01-17-bring-your-monorepo-down-to-size-with-sparse-checkout/</li> </ul>"},{"location":"while-coding/postgres_notes/","title":"Postgres Notes","text":""},{"location":"while-coding/postgres_notes/#using-docker","title":"Using docker","text":"<p>install postgres using docker:</p> <pre><code>sudo docker run --name postgresql-container -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secretpw -d postgres\n</code></pre> <p>If you have already created the container above, then just start it</p> <pre><code>sudo docker start postgresql-container\n</code></pre> <p>start PGadmin (but this was not able to query the db and giving internal server errors):</p> <pre><code>docker run --rm -p 5050:5050 thajeztah/pgadmin4\n</code></pre> <p>login to the postgres container shell: <pre><code>sudo docker exec -ti p1 bash\n</code></pre></p> <p>then switch to default user <pre><code>su postgres\n</code></pre></p> <p>start psql <pre><code>psql\n</code></pre></p> <p>Now you can do <code>\\dt</code> to see all the tables.

Encryption includes encryption and decryption process while hashing is a one-way process that derives a message digest (alphnumeric string ) from data. This string is irreversible meaning you can't derive data back from string. </p> <p>Hashing algorithms:</p> <p>SHA algorithm \u2013 Secure Hash Algorithm was designed by the National Security Agency to be used in their digital signature algorithm. It has a length of 160 bits. Just like the latter, security weaknesses in it means that it is no longer used SHA and SHA-1, organizations are using strong SHA-2 (256 bit) algorithm for the cryptographic purpose. </p> <p>Usages:</p> <ul> <li>systems store password in hashed format. Meaning to confirm password is correct or not they derive SHA256 hash from it and compare the hash. For same password, everytime the has will be same.</li> <li>Check the authenticity of downloaded files. </li> <li>Download provider provides file and also publishes SHA256sum with it. User after download can generate SHA256sum from downloaded file and compare with what is published by the provider. If the downloaded file has been corrupted during download or if it is different from the original one, then the SHA will not be the same. This provides protection against network corruptions to large files plus limited assurance of authenticity of the file that it is the one that was produced by original producer. For full authenticity, producers should publish GPG signatures and downloaders should verify that.</li> </ul> <p>Purpose of hashing:</p> <p>Hashing can be used to compare a large amount of data. Hash values can be created for different data, meaning that it is easier comparing hashes than the data itself.  It is easy to find a record when the data is hashed. Hashing algorithms are used in cryptographic applications like a digital signature. Hashing is used to generate random strings to avoid duplication of data stored in databases. Geometric hashing \u2013 widely used in computer graphics to find closet pairs and proximity problems in planes. It is also called grid method and it has also been adopted in telecommunications. These characteristics mean that hash can be used to store passwords. This way, it becomes difficult for someone who has the raw data to reverse them.</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/random-notes/#gpg-signatures-on-packages-aka-artifacts","title":"GPG signatures on packages aka artifacts","text":"<p>Good link for understanding : https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/random-notes/#how-to-check-hash-for-python-pip-packages","title":"how to check hash for python (pip) packages","text":"<ul> <li>pip gets packages from pypi.

Use CONFIG REWRITE to make this change permanent. 2) Alternatively you can just disable the protected mode by editing the Redis configuration file, and setting the protected mode option to 'no', and then restarting the server. 3) If you started the server manually just for testing, restart it with the '--protected-mode no' option. 4) Set up an authentication password for the default user. NOTE: You only need to do one of the above things in order for the server to start accepting connections from the outside.</p> <p>-------------fix ------------- uncommented below line requirepass foobared</p> <p>and kept below line as it is protected-mode</p> <p>getting </p> <p>[ERR] Node 10.229.38.197:6379 NOAUTH Authentication required.</p> <p>and changed the cluster create command to (added -a)</p> <p>redis-cli -a 'foobared' --cluster create 10.229.38.197:6379 10.229.38.96:6379 10.229.38.183:6379 10.229.38.97:6379 10.229.38.122:6379 10.229.38.45:6379 --cluster-replicas 1</p> <p>this resolved the above error.</p> <p>AUTH  <p>AUTH default"},{"location":"while-coding/release-please-notes/","title":"Release Please : Github Release automation tool from Google","text":""},{"location":"while-coding/release-please-notes/#configuring-release-please-on-a-spring-boot-project","title":"Configuring release-please on a spring-boot project","text":"<ol> <li>Create a <code>.github/workflows/release-please.yml</code></li> <li>Add these contents to that file    ```    on:     push:       branches:         - main</li> </ol> <p>permissions:      contents: write      pull-requests: write</p> <p>name: release-please</p> <p>jobs:      release-please:        runs-on: ubuntu-latest        steps:          - uses: googleapis/release-please-action@v4            with:              # this assumes that you have created a personal access token              # (PAT) and configured it as a GitHub action secret named              # <code>MY_RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN</code> (this secret name is not important).              token: ${{ secrets.MY_RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN }}              # this is a built-in strategy in release-please, see \"Action Inputs\"              # for more options              release-type: simple     <code>``  3.

A client uses a DPoP proof JWT to prove the possession of a private key corresponding to a certain public key.\n\nRoughly speaking, a DPoP proof is a signature over some data of the HTTP request to which it is attached, a timestamp, a unique identifier, an optional server-provided nonce, and a hash of the associated access token when an access token is present within the request.\n</code></pre> <p>Using DPoP means, client sending DPoP proof when requesting a new access token, plus client sendig DPoP proof along with access token to access the protected resources. The DPoP proof is sent as value of request header <code>DPoP</code>. DPoP proofs(JWT) used in both steps are generated by client using a slightly different methods. The payload differs in both cases. In the first case (while requesting a new access token), the dpop proof JWT payload doesn't have hash created from access token. In the second case (while requesting a protected resource), the DPoP proof has the hash of the access token in it's payload. </p> <p>So, DPoP proof can be generated by client, and it is a JWT. (this JWT is created by HTTP request data (API that client want to access), timestamp, a unique id and optionally a server nonce, plus access token hash if request is also having the <code>Bearer</code> header with access token. And sign all these data elements using private key to create a JWT.</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/IAM/OAuth2_oidc_notes/#oauth-20-rich-authorization-requests-draft-rfc","title":"OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (draft RFC)","text":"<p>Interpretation of the value of the \"type\" parameter, and the object    elements that the \"type\" parameter allows, is under the control of    the AS.</p> <p>change areas:</p> <ul> <li>Authorization requests as specified in [RFC6749],</li> <li>Device Authorization Request as specified in [RFC8628],</li> <li>Backchannel Authentication Requests as defined in [OpenID.CIBA].</li> </ul>"},{"location":"while-coding/IAM/OAuth2_oidc_notes/#shortforms","title":"Shortforms:","text":"<p><code>RP</code>: Relying Party (client) <code>OP</code>: OpenID provider</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/IAM/OAuth2_oidc_notes/#notes-from-httpswwwudemycomcourseenterprise-oauth-for-developers","title":"Notes from : https://www.udemy.com/course/enterprise-oauth-for-developers","text":""},{"location":"while-coding/IAM/OAuth2_oidc_notes/#usecases","title":"Usecases:","text":"<ol> <li>Introduction</li> <li>Websites asking you to login using facebook/google login</li> <li>email clients like outlook on your windows desktop that wants to aggregate emails from gmail, yahoo, etc</li> <li>TV that gives you a code to enter into a mobile app in order to log into tv app</li> <li>sites that aggregate hotel data and in order to show you cheapest rentals</li> <li> <p>finance apps taht show your finances at one place</p> </li> <li> <p>Security basics (Authentication and Authorization)</p> </li> <li>Service provider: This is the target application that is being protected.

An\nassertion typically contains information about a subject or\nprincipal, information about the party that issued the assertion and\nwhen was it issued, and the conditions under which the assertion is\nto be considered valid, such as when and where it can be used.\n\nThe entity that creates and signs or integrity-protects the assertion\nis typically known as the \"Issuer\", and the entity that consumes the\nassertion and relies on its information is typically known as the\n\"Relying Party\".  In the context of this document, the authorization\nserver acts as a relying party.\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>assertions MUST be signed or signed+encrypted</li> <li>there are two common patterns by which client can obtain </li> <li>issued by third party (also called <code>security token service</code>, <code>token service</code>) ( see, now at this point, <code>assertion</code> is being called <code>token</code>. This is the reason behind token often being called assertion in general.)</li> <li>client creates assertions locally (using shared secret or private-public key pair). Although assertions are usually used to convey identity and     security information, self-issued assertions can also serve a different purpose.  They can be used to demonstrate knowledge of some secret, such as a client secret, without actually communicating the secret directly in the transaction.</li> </ul> <p>From the perspective of what must be done by the entity presenting the assertion, there are two general types of assertions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Bearer Assertions: (Note: this is the origin of <code>bearer</code> token). Any entity in possession of a bearer assertion (the bearer) can use it to get access to the associated resources (without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key).  To prevent misuse, bearer assertions need to be protected from disclosure in storage and in transport.  Secure communication channels are required between all entities to avoid leaking the assertion to unauthorized parties.</p> </li> <li> <p>Holder-of-Key Assertions: To access the associated resources, the entity presenting the assertion must demonstrate possession of additional cryptographic material.  The token service thereby binds a key identifier to the assertion, and the client has to demonstrate to the relying party that it knows the key corresponding to that identifier when presenting the assertion.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assertion framework itself doesn't specify format(like JSON etc) but it points to SAML and JWT specs for implementation details. JWT, as we know, is the more prefered and widely used. So this is how assertions, tokens and JWT are connected to each other via OAuth Assertion Framework.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This spec details two usages of assertions (read JWT) in two ways when communicating to <code>token endpoint</code>: - Using Assertions as Authorization Grants - Using Assertions for Client Authentication (from here the client authn methods of <code>client_secret_jwt</code> and <code>private_key_jwt</code> originates)</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/IAM/OAuth2_oidc_notes/#software-statement_1","title":"Software Statement","text":"<ul> <li>Defining Software statements: Under https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591#section-1.2</li> </ul> <pre><code>A digitally signed or MACed JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] that\nasserts metadata values about the client software.

How does weight of a person change relative to their height. </li> <li>linear regression: The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which the purpose is to find the line that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares(OLS) computes the unique line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the data and that line. This line can then be extended to predict unseen data. Another way to perform linear regression is  <code>gradient descent</code>. This method is better for 3 dimensional or multi-dimentional data. </li> <li> <p>r-squared:</p> <p>First understand The r value, or correlation coefficient. It measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1. An r value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, while -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0 means no correlation exists.</p> <p>Now <code>r-squared</code> is a method of knowing how well the line is fitting the data. It has a value between 0 to 1.  1 means that line is right in the middle of the observations, meaning that each dot(observation) is at equal distance from the line on the both sides, hence it is the best fitting line that you have, i.e the line has fully minimised the squared differences from observations. 0 mean the line does not, at all, minimise the squared differences and is a worse fit. </p> <p>How r-squared helps: You can create a regression for your data using different techniques (eg. linear, logistic etc). R-squared helps you in choosing the correct regression technique. Higher r-squared means that the model has created a line that is correctely showing the trend. But r-squared is only one parameter in choosing the model, there are many more considerations based on what kind of data you have etc. See the table below.</p> </li> <li> <p>different regression techniques</p> </li> </ul> Regression Type Description Typical Use Case Linear Regression Models a straight-line relationship between one or more independent variables and a continuous dependent variable. Predicting house prices, sales trends, or temperature levels. Multiple Linear Regression Extension of linear regression using multiple predictors for a single continuous outcome. Estimating employee salaries from multiple features (experience, education, etc.). Logistic Regression Used when the dependent variable is categorical (binary or multinomial). Predicts probabilities between 0 and 1. Classifying spam vs. not-spam emails, churn prediction. Polynomial Regression Fits a non-linear (curved) relationship between variables using polynomial terms. Modeling growth curves or complex biological relationships. Ridge Regression A linear regression with L2 regularization, reducing coefficient magnitude to handle multicollinearity and overfitting. High-dimensional datasets with correlated features. Lasso Regression Uses L1 regularization to shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection. Sparse feature selection in big data problems <ul> <li>Multiple linear regression:   In normal regression, you are trying to predict the value of one dependent variable, based on another single influencing variable. Like predicting height based on age. Here age is the only influencing factor.  In multiple regression, you have multiple influencing variable instead of one. Like predicting car price based on brand, type(passenger or commercial), seating capacity etc.</li> <li>Multivariate regression: Unlike linear and multiple regression, where we are trying to predict the value of one signle dependent variable using one or more variables, in multivariate regression we are trying to predict multiple dependent variables. Like predicting price and time-to-sell of a car based on brand, type(passenger or commercial), seating capacity etc.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"while-coding/ai/course-notes-udemy-ml-ds-ai/#supervised-and-unsupervised-learning","title":"Supervised and unsupervised learning","text":"<ul> <li>Supervised:   We give the categories (classifications) to the algorithm, train it to classify data in certain buckets, and then let it classify the actual data.

Because of this, building LLM based application is very fast and easy. And that is because lot of people are creating such applications that are just wrappers on top of an third-party LLM.</li> <li>You can take an LLM, and improve it for your usecase using RAG, model fine-tuning, pretrain models. This takes some efforts but has more value</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>What is a token:   Token doesn't always mean a single <code>word</code>. It is how LLM considers a word. For example, common words like <code>the example</code> may be considered to be a single token. While words like <code>programming</code> might be considered as two tokens (<code>program</code>+<code>ming</code>). So, on the average <code>1 token</code> = <code>3/4 of a word</code>. So for 300 words would roughly equal to 400 tokens.</p> </li> <li> <p>LLM charges: LLM models like chatGPT and others charge different rates for input tokens and output tokens. For example, price for input would be 0.0001$/1k tokens, while output is usually costlier like 0.002$/1k tokens. With this rate, it takes 0.08$ to create 40k tokens. 40k tokens is enough reading material for one adult for an hour. So, overall, using 3rd party LLMs is cheap.</p> </li> <li> <p>think of LLM as a reasoning engine in addition to knowing lot of things. This way of thinking will expand the usecases where LLMs can be used. Future uses of LLMs will be leveraging reasoning capabilities more than knowledge bank.</p> </li> <li>My note: So LLM = Reasoning engine + data store(RAG etc)</li> </ul> <p>Pretraining: training models on large data set to make it a general purpose model. This is expensive because it needs lot of data and effort. Only large tech companies do it. Models like chatgpt, deepseek etc</p> <p>RAG: is about improving the prompt with specific contextual data. This is used when adding a large set of context data to the prompt is not feasible or it is expensive. In this case, RAG will look at the large context and pick relevent context data and give it along with the prompt so that focus is narrowed down.</p> <p>fine-tuning: is used when you want to the model to generate responses using specific domain specific terms(legal, medical etc) and writing styles (shakespearian, british english etc). In such cases you have to take a generic pretrained model and fine tune it by providing a small set of your data to make it understand how to generate responses with specific terms and styles.</p> <p>Choosing pretrained model: -  1B param - good for sentiment analysis -  10B - Good for a chatbot -  100B - good for brainstorming -  You have to try different models and choose which works for you.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Closed source Vs open-weight models Vs Open source models:</p> </li> <li> <p>LLMs don't just predict the next word to give you the right answer. It has to understand your instructions(prompt) as well. And after understanding the prompt, it has to be trained to give answer in certain way. For example, if you ask for help from chatgpt, it starts the response by saying <code>sure, here are the steps</code>, so this part is not predicted from the internet. They have trained LLM to respond in this way. This is called <code>instruction tuning</code>. Also, LLMs learn from your rating of good or bad answer. This happens when you hit \ud83d\udc4d or \ud83d\udc4e on the answer you received. This is called RLHF (Reinforcement learning by Human feedback).</p> </li> <li> <p>Use of AI/LLM in a usecase or task:</p> </li> </ul> <p>It can either <code>augment</code> or <code>automate</code> a task.</p> <ul> <li>Augment: help human being do the task better</li> <li>Automate: Complete the task fully</li> </ul> <p>Companies should see what each job roles. What do they do. A job is made up of small-small tasks. So, break down a job into small small task. Evaluate which tasks can be automated and which can be augmented. Start with augmentation and move towards automation.</p> <p>Also, while looking at a role and evaluating possibility of using AI (augment/automate) for that role, we tend to look at the main task of that role only. But in reality, a person in that role may be doing many other surrounding tasks where AI can automate or augment. For example, when thinking about, can AI do a programmer's job, we tend to think that programmers do only coding. So the question that we start thinking is that <code>Can AI do coding</code>. But actually programmer do lot of other things like documentation, meetings, emailing, customer support etc. We should think about applying AI to any of these areas when thinking about AI for programmers.</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/ai/machine-learning/","title":"Machine Learning","text":"<p>https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/ai/mcp/","title":"Model Context Protocol","text":""},{"location":"while-coding/ai/mcp/#reference","title":"Reference:","text":"<ul> <li>Good quick video for creating local agent with MCP (OllamaIndex, Ollama): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C64rVY1eN8k</li> </ul>"},{"location":"while-coding/ai/mcp/#notes-from-mcp-for-beginners-hands-on-repo","title":"Notes from mcp for beginners hands-on repo","text":"<ul> <li>very good to get high-level picture of what MCP is and overall usefulness: https://github.com/microsoft/mcp-for-beginners/blob/main/00-Introduction/README.md</li> <li>List of MCP servers</li> </ul>"},{"location":"while-coding/ai/mcp/#high-level-flow","title":"High level flow:","text":"<p>MCP servers operate in the following way:</p> <ul> <li>Request Flow:</li> <li>A request is initiated by an end user or software acting on their behalf.</li> <li>The MCP Client sends the request to an MCP Host, which manages the AI Model runtime.</li> <li>The AI Model receives the user prompt and may request access to external tools or data via one or more tool calls.</li> <li>The MCP Host, not the model directly, communicates with the appropriate MCP Server(s) using the standardized protocol.</li> <li>MCP Host Functionality:</li> <li>Tool Registry: Maintains a catalog of available tools and their capabilities.</li> <li>Authentication: Verifies permissions for tool access.</li> <li>Request Handler: Processes incoming tool requests from the model.</li> <li>Response Formatter: Structures tool outputs in a format the model can understand.</li> <li>MCP Server Execution:</li> <li>The MCP Host routes tool calls to one or more MCP Servers, each exposing specialized functions (e.g., search, calculations, database queries).</li> <li>The MCP Servers perform their respective operations and return results to the MCP Host in a consistent format.</li> <li>The MCP Host formats and relays these results to the AI Model.</li> <li>Response Completion:</li> <li>The AI Model incorporates the tool outputs into a final response.</li> <li>The MCP Host sends this response back to the MCP Client, which delivers it to the end user or calling software.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"while-coding/ai/mcp/#architecture","title":"Architecture","text":"<p>Reference</p> <ul> <li>MCP Hosts: Programs like VSCode, Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP</li> <li>MCP Clients: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers</li> <li>MCP Servers: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol</li> <li>Local Data Sources: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access</li> <li>Remote Services: External systems available over the internet that MCP servers can connect to through APIs.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"while-coding/ai/mcp/#security","title":"Security","text":"<ul> <li>MCP authorization spec: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization</li> <li>MCP clients must add <code>resource</code>: The specification now requires client developers to implement RFC 8707 - Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0. link</li> </ul>"},{"location":"while-coding/ai/mcp/#imp","title":"imp","text":"<ul> <li><code>resource</code> and <code>aud</code>:</li> </ul> <p>When an MCP client requests a token, they include a resource parameter (per RFC 8707) specifying the exact MCP server they're accessing.

If a server goes down, you still have a local copy of the project.</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/certifications/GitHub/github-fundamentals/#terminologies","title":"Terminologies:","text":"<p>Working tree: The set of nested directories and files that contain the project that's being worked on.</p> <p>Repository (repo): Repo is a directory. The directory, located at the top level of a working tree, where Git keeps all the history and metadata for a project. Repositories are almost always referred to as repos. A bare repository is one that isn't part of a working tree; it's used for sharing or backup. A bare repo is usually a directory with a name that ends in .git\u2014for example, project.git.</p> <p>Hash: A number produced by a hash function that represents the contents of a file or another object as a fixed number of digits. Git uses hashes that are 160 bits long. One advantage to using hashes is that Git can tell whether a file has changed by hashing its contents and comparing the result to the previous hash. If the file time-and-date stamp is changed, but the file hash isn\u2019t changed, Git knows the file contents aren\u2019t changed.</p> <p>Object: A Git repo contains four types of objects, each uniquely identified by an SHA-1 hash. A blob object contains an ordinary file. A tree object represents a directory; it contains names, hashes, and permissions. A commit object represents a specific version of the working tree. A tag is a name attached to a commit.</p> <p>Commit: When used as a verb, commit means to make a commit object. This action takes its name from commits to a database. It means you are committing the changes you have made so that others can eventually see them, too.</p> <p>Branch: A branch is a named series of linked commits. The most recent commit on a branch is called the head. The default branch, which is created when you initialize a repository, is called main, often named master in Git. The head of the current branch is named HEAD(in caps). Branches are an incredibly useful feature of Git because they allow developers to work independently (or together) in branches and later merge their changes into the default branch.</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/certifications/GitHub/github-fundamentals/#features-provided-by-github-on-top-of-git","title":"Features provided by GitHub on top of Git","text":"<p>Key features provided by GitHub include:</p> <ul> <li>Issues</li> <li>Discussions</li> <li>Pull requests</li> <li>Notifications</li> <li>Labels</li> <li>Actions</li> <li>Forks</li> <li>Projects</li> </ul> <p>Remote: A remote is a named reference to another Git repository. When you create a repo, Git creates a remote named origin that is the default remote for push and pull operations.</p> <p>Commands, subcommands, and options: Git operations are performed by using commands like git push and git pull. git is the command, and push or pull is the subcommand. The subcommand specifies the operation you want Git to perform. Commands frequently are accompanied by options, which use hyphens (-) or double hyphens (--).

Required only if you want to access  1) click on 'Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy' 2) under 'security', check 'Block project-wide SSH keys' 3) create public key on your local machine from where you need ssh access to GCP vm and paste public key in 'enter public key' text area Note on how to get public key : cd ~/.ssh cat id_dsa.pub ( if this file exists then copy the content from it and paste it in the GCP text area) if this file doesn't exist then run command 'ssh-keygen -o' to generate this file and copy the content from it to GCP text area)</p> <p>When you paste public key in the 'enter public key' area, GCP will auto detect user name from public key and display it on the left of the text area.  This is your username when trying to ssh connection from your local pc to GCP vm.  So, make note of this name.  ( if you don't want to do ssh setup and all, you can skip 1,2,3 above and instead directly click 'create'. Once your VM is ready, on the GCP 'VM instance' dashboard,  you can click on drop-down under 'connect' column, and select  'open in browser window'. This will give you a in-browser commandline client.)</p> <p>click 'create' Once your VM is creaeted and if you have done ssh setup like in above 1,2,3, then you can connect to your vm from your local machine using command below : ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa dhaval@34.123.24.4 here 'dhaval' is username that we noted in 3 above, and IP is 'external ip'  as mentioned on gcp 'vm instances' dashboard.</p> <p>make external IP as permanent : at this point, the external IP assinged to your VM is ephemeral.

( if whole gluu server is install on development machine then you don't need this )</p> <p>1) configure IP as mentioned in bind_ip_addresses section of  https://gluu.org/docs/oxd/configuration/oxd-configuration/#server-configuration-fields-descriptions if you are going to mention IP of your local system then your external IP needs to be mentioned. Which you can find by 'curl ifconfig.me' on Ubuntu command prompt. But  I suggest you don't use your external IP in oxd config file as external ip may change everytime you restart your local system. Better use ['*'].</p> <p>Now restart oxd service using : systemctl restart oxd-server</p> <p>Now we need to configure GCP firewall to allow traffic on port 8443. Go to your gcp dashboard of your project -&gt; search 'firewall' -&gt; open the firewall  named 'default-allow-https' and edit it to add 8443 in the port list as below.</p> <p>now if you try the health check url, you'll get response as below : {    \"application\": \"oxd\",    \"version\": \"4.2.3.Final\",    \"status\": \"running\" }</p> <p>3) I couldn't successfully execute the third step of configuring letsencrypt certificates. This is due to the fact that in order to get a letsencrypt. but if whole gluu server is install on development machine then you don't need to do this.</p> <p>at this point you below endpoints should be working in your setup : https://test.gcp.gluu.org/identity/home.htm https://test.gcp.gluu.org:8443/health-check https://test.gcp.gluu.org/.well-known/openid-configuration https://test.gcp.gluu.org/.well-known/scim-configuration (if you have install scim)</p> <p>also if you are running oxd demo spring app locally, it should also return 'hello' page with oxd id on below url (port as you configurd) https://localhost:8083/ Now start oxd configuration (reference : https://gluu.org/docs/oxd/configuration/oxd-configuration/) : In the Gluu shell : goto /opt/oxd-server/conf/oxd-server.yml and set below properties. Customise values as per your setup: op_configuration_endpoint: 'https://test.gcp.gluu.org/.well-known/openid-configuration'</p> <p>---- run the spring oxd app : get it from git and change following properties in application.properties server.port=8083 oxd.server.op-host=https://test.gcp.gluu.org oxd.server.host=test.gcp.gluu.org oxd.client.callback-uri=https://localhost:8083/gluu/callback oxd.client.post-logout-uri=https://localhost:8083/gluu/logout</p> <p>Uninstallation</p> <p>For Ubuntu Server 20.x and Ubuntu Server 18.04.x, run the following commands:</p> <p>/sbin/gluu-serverd disable</p> <p>/sbin/gluu-serverd stop</p> <p>apt remove gluu-server</p> <p>rm -fr /opt/gluu-server.save</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/janssen/janssen-notes/#troubleshooting","title":"troubleshooting","text":"<p>getting 503 when trying to access oxtrust of a gluu server newly installed on a kvm ( 2cpu, 4gb ).

User trigger install.py and this script inturn calls setup.py for installation task. On top of installation Install.py provides uninstall, upgrade like functions.  Below are the actions that install.py and setup.py scripts take when executed.</p> <p>Install.py When triggered this script first downloads third party software like JDK, Jython etc  for example: Downloading https://corretto.aws/downloads/resources/11.0.8.10.1/amazon-corretto-11.0.8.10.1-linux-x64.tar.gz to /opt/dist/app/amazon-corretto-11.0.8.10.1-linux-x64.tar.gz Plus it also downloads Janssen artifacts from Github and maven. Artifacts like jans-setup.zip,  for example : Downloading https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans-setup/archive/master.zip to /opt/dist/jans/jans-setup.zip Downloading https://maven.jans.io/maven/io/jans/jans-auth-server/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/jans-auth-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war to /opt/dist/jans/jans-auth.war Downloading https://maven.jans.io/maven/io/jans/jans-auth-client/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/jans-auth-client-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar to /opt/dist/jans/jans-auth-client-jar-with-dependencies.jar Downloading https://maven.jans.io/maven/io/jans/jans-config-api/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/jans-config-api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar to /opt/dist/jans/jans-config-api-runner.jar Downloading https://maven.jans.io/maven/io/jans/jans-fido2-server/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/jans-fido2-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war to /opt/dist/jans/jans-fido2.war Downloading https://maven.jans.io/maven/io/jans/jans-scim-server/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/jans-scim-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war to /opt/dist/jans/jans-scim.war Downloading https://jenkins.jans.io/maven/io/jans/jans-eleven-server/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/jans-eleven-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war to /opt/dist/jans/jans-eleven.war</p> <p>Please note that all Janssen artifacts are downloaded from https://maven.jans.io/maven/io/jans/</p> <p>then arguments of script invocation are parsed. Here one important usage is of --args argument. If you  want to pass any argument to setup.py which is called by install.py then you have to pass that argument to install.py as below. For example you want to call setup.py with -t argument, then</p> <p>python3 install.py --args=-t</p> <p>Important Jans directories are also set in script :</p> <p>jans_dir = '/opt/jans' app_dir = '/opt/dist/app' jans_app_dir = '/opt/dist/jans' scripts_dir = '/opt/dist/scripts' jetty_home = '/opt/jans/jetty'</p> <p>After this it takes actions according to arguments passed, like upgrade or uninstall or install. For installation option, install.py triggers setup.py</p>"},{"location":"while-coding/janssen/janssen-notes/#setuppy","title":"setup.py","text":"<p>jar and war files for janssen modules like  check if all third party software are already installed.

The app enables parents to easily share a public link with invitees, who can reserve gifts and split contributions, while WishShare earns commissions on successful reservations. The MVP focuses on reservation and split calculation, with external fulfillment and no in-app payments at launch.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n### Business Goals\n\n* Achieve 10,000 wishlist creations within 90 days of launch.\n\n* Drive at least 30% of wishlists to have one or more items reserved by invitees.\n\n* Generate initial commission revenue from at least 20% of reserved gifts.\n\n* Establish partnerships with 3+ major Indian e-commerce retailers for product link integration.\n\n* Maintain a reservation success rate (no double-claims) above 99%.\n\n### User Goals\n\n* Allow parents to easily create and manage a wishlist for their child\u2019s birthday.\n\n* Enable seamless sharing of the wishlist link with family and friends.\n\n* Ensure invitees can reserve gifts and coordinate split contributions without confusion.\n\n* Provide clear visibility to parents on which gifts are claimed and by whom.\n\n* Reduce duplicate gifting and social friction around gift selection.\n\n### Non-Goals\n\n* No child or non-parent editing of wishlists in the MVP.\n\n* No in-app payment processing or direct fulfillment at launch.\n\n* No support for anonymous or invite-only wishlists in the MVP (public link only).\n\n---\n\n## User Personas &amp;

She\u2019s tired of receiving duplicate gifts and wants to make it easier for her family to choose something Aarav will truly love. Priya downloads WishShare, quickly creates a wishlist with toys, books, and a cricket set, and sets a reservation deadline a week before the party. She shares the link with her family WhatsApp group.\n\nAarav\u2019s uncle and aunt open the link, see the wishlist, and decide to reserve the cricket set together using the split contribution feature. The app calculates their share and confirms their reservation. Priya\u2019s sister picks a book and reserves it in one tap. As the deadline approaches, Priya receives notifications showing which gifts are claimed and by whom, giving her peace of mind that there will be no duplicates.\n\nOn the day of the party, Aarav receives the gifts he wanted, and Priya\u2019s family feels happy to have contributed meaningfully.

Low friction for users; reliable volume play. Trade-off: requires partner integrations and tracking.\n- Convenience fee on reservations/payments: charge a small fixed fee (\u20b910\u2013\u20b950) per claimed gift or a 1\u20133% processing fee for split-pay collections. Predictable revenue and easier to explain. Risk: sensitivity to fees for low-value gifts.\n\nFeature / product-led revenue\n- Premium family tier (monthly/yearly): \u20b999\u2013\u20b9299/month or \u20b9699\u2013\u20b91,999/year with features: unlimited wishlists, priority placement in share link, no convenience fees, smart gift suggestions, calendar sync, locked parental controls, advanced analytics (who viewed/when). Good ARPU; conversion depends on perceived value.\n- Featured placement / promoted gifts: merchants or parents can pay to pin or highlight items in a wishlist or in discovery flows. High-margin but must avoid degrading trust.\n\nTransaction-adjacent services\n- Gift contribution management / escrow: hold pooled contributions until deadline; charge 1\u20132% escrow fee. Reduces failed payments and increases completion rates; requires stronger compliance/KYC for payments.\n- Gift wrapping / concierge + shipping referrals: partner with local vendors and collect referral fees or markups. Higher margin but needs logistics partnerships.\n\nMarketplace and merchant partnerships\n- Affiliate store / curated marketplace: show merchants within the app; take referral fees and run co-marketing with brands targeting parents/children. Drives stickiness and monetizes browsing behavior.\n- Bulk/offline gifting for extended family (corporate gifting): offering corporate/large-family packages for festivals; higher ticket size and margins.\n\nAdvertising &amp; data\n- Non-intrusive contextual ads: only in discovery or merchant browse (no ads on private wishlists). Low-yield; risk to UX.\n- Aggregated insights for brands (anonymized): trends, popular gifts by age/region \u2014 sell as periodic reports or APIs. Must ensure strict privacy and compliance.\n\nGrowth-to-revenue levers (recommended sequence)\n1. Launch with reservation + affiliate links + small convenience fee to validate conversion and partner tracking.  \n2. Introduce split-pay escrow and convenience fee once group payments scale.  \n3. Add premium subscription with clear, measurable benefits (no fees, priority links) at month 3\u20136.  \n4. Open merchant partnerships and promoted placements after user base and usage patterns are clear.  \n5. Explore concierge/wrapping and B2B packages once logistics partners are secured.\n\nPricing guidance and KPIs\n- Commission: start 5\u20138% for affiliates; test up to 12% with exclusive partners.  \n- Convenience/escrow fee: \u20b910\u2013\u20b950 or 1\u20133% per transaction.  \n- Subscription price: test \u20b999/mo and \u20b9699/yr; target 2\u20135% conversion of active families.  \n- KPIs to track: take rate (net rev / GMV), conversion from view\u2192claim, split-pay completion rate, ARPU by cohort, churn for premium, CAC payback.\n\nRisks &amp; mitigations\n- Fee sensitivity: mitigate with a clear value proposition (guaranteed claim, escrow safety, no duplicate gifts).  \n- Partner dependence: diversify merchant partners, add direct merchant onboarding for high-margin SKUs.  \n- Trust/privacy: be transparent on data use and keep wishlists private-by\u2011link.\n\nPick two monetization paths you want prioritized (e.g., affiliate + convenience fee; or premium + escrow) and I\u2019ll map required product changes, partner types, and a 3\u2011month revenue experiment plan.\n</code></pre> <p>prompt - 4</p> <p>what are the existing competitors for this kind of app worldwide?</p> <p>ans - 4</p> <pre><code>Below are existing competitors (global and India-relevant), grouped by product type with one-line differentiator and source links.\n\nUniversal / gift-wishlist apps\n- Giftful \u2014 shareable wishlists with claiming and group-gift support.

Which three competitors should I analyze in depth?\n</code></pre> <p>Prompt - 5</p> <p>let's prioritize competitor map. We are focused on preventing duplicate gifts and getting more useful and meaningful gifts. We don't want to handle payments.</p> <p>Ans - 5</p> <pre><code>I reviewed your PRD. Below is a prioritized competitor map focused on duplicate-prevention and improving gift relevance (no payments).\n\nTop competitors to analyze (ranked)\n1. Giftster \u2014 family-centered wishlists; strong at duplicate prevention and cross-device syncing.  \n2. Giftful \u2014 shareable wishlists + group-gift reservation; good UX for claiming items.  \n3. Listery \u2014 mobile-first list aggregation from multiple stores; simple sharing and add-from-web.  \n4. MyRegistry / MyRegistry-like universal registries (Zola-style) \u2014 powerful add-from-any-store and duplication checks at scale.  \n5. Elfster \u2014 wishlist + Secret-Santa; good social features that drive meaningful gift selection.  \n6. GroupTogether (feature-level) \u2014 group-gift coordination (useful UX patterns for contributors, but payment-focused).\n\nFeature-by-feature comparison (what matters for your goals)\n- Add-from-any-store / browser clipper\n  - Winners: Listery, MyRegistry \u2014 easy aggregation reduces manual entries and increases relevance.\n  - Opportunity: Many apps miss localized Indian merchants and UPI/WhatsApp flows.\n- Duplicate detection &amp; reservation\n  - Winners: Giftster, Giftful \u2014 realtime claiming, visible \u201creserved by X\u201d badges, and expiry windows.\n  - Gap: Few offer intelligent duplicate alerts for similar SKUs (e.g., same toy model at different sellers).\n- Social signals &amp; context (why this gift matters)\n  - Winners: Elfster, Giftful \u2014 comments, senders\u2019 notes, gift stories increase meaning.\n  - Gap: Limited structured prompts (e.g., \u201cWhy child wants this / occasion relevance / size/color\u201d).\n- Guidance for useful gifts (age-fit, longevity, educational value)\n  - Winners: N/A (mostly manual) \u2014 registries rarely score gifts for \u201cusefulness.\u201d  \n  - Opportunity: algorithmic tagging (age appropriateness, developmental benefits) plus curator badges.\n- Frictionless sharing/viewing (no-login link access)\n  - Winners: Giftful, Giftster \u2014 link-based access and SMS/WhatsApp friendly.\n  - Your PRD already targets this; good competitive parity.\n- Group-claiming without payments\n  - Winners: Giftful supports reservation; GroupTogether handles money.  \n  - Opportunity: allow multi-invitee reservation commitment (e.g., pledge %/role) without collecting funds.\n- Privacy / parental control\n  - Winners: Giftster (family privacy controls).  \n  - Must-have: parent-only edit + child-preview mode per your spec.\n\nGaps in market (opportunities to win)\n- Localized store integrations for India (Flipkart, Amazon India, FirstCry, local kirana/brands). Many competitors focus Western stores.  \n- Intelligent duplicate detection across SKUs and variants (model, size, color, UPC/title similarity).  \n- Structured context fields that encourage more meaningful gifts (reason, how it will be used, longevity score).  \n- \u201cIntent to buy\u201d commitments (non-payment pledges) and soft reservations with deadline escalation (reminder nudges, reassignment if expired).  \n- Curated suggestions prioritized by age, educational value, eco/fair-trade badges \u2014 help parents craft more useful lists.  \n- Social proof from family (ratings, past-gift success) to guide meaningful choices.\n\nWhat to copy (fast wins)\n- Link-based viewing + one-tap reserve (Giftful/Giftster UX).  \n- Browser/mobile clipper to add items from any store (Listery/MyRegistry).  \n- Visible reservation badges and expiry timers (Giftster/Giftful).\n\nWhat to avoid or change\n- Avoid over-reliance on manual list entry \u2014 increases friction.  \n- Avoid payment-first UX patterns (GroupTogether) since you won\u2019t handle payments; instead use clear pledge/reservation states.  \n- Avoid generic discovery feeds that push merchants over useful/age\u2011appropriate suggestions.\n\nRecommended product features to prioritize (MVP)\n1. Add-from-any-store mobile clipper + manual add with image/title/URL/price.  \n2. Robust duplicate-detection engine (title/UPC/image similarity + variant matching) with admin override.  \n3. Link-sharing with no-login view and one-tap \u201cReserve\u201d (show reserver name + pledge note).  \n4. Multi-person pledge (e.g., \u201cI\u2019ll chip in\u201d toggle) without money handling; support deadline and automatic release on expiry.  \n5. Structured gift-context fields: age range, why wanted, usage frequency, durability score (parent inputs).  \n6. Curated suggestions/rules engine that scores items for usefulness and surfaces alternatives.  \n7. Nudges &amp; reassignment flows: reminders before deadline, automatic suggestions for unreserved high-priority items.\n\nQuick experiment plan (first 8 weeks)\n- Week 0\u20132: Build clipper + add-item flow + shareable link + simple reserve toggle.  \n- Week 3\u20135: Implement duplicate-detection and visible reservation/expiry badges.  \n- Week 6\u20138: Add structured gift-context fields + basic suggestion engine; run 50-family pilot in one Indian city (WhatsApp distribution).\n\nIf you want, I\u2019ll: (A) create a competitor feature matrix (spreadsheet) with exact UX examples and screenshots for the six competitors; or (B) draft the MVP feature spec and 8-week roadmap to implement the prioritized features. Which do you prefer?\n</code></pre> <p>Prompt: How profitable is the giftster? what is the revenue? and major markets?</p> <p>Ans:</p> <pre><code>Short answer: Giftster is a privately held company so it does not publish full financial statements or public profit figures. Public signals we can cite:\n\n- Giftster reports &gt;2 million members (2023) and says tracked conversion dollar volume sent to retail partners totaled about $102M in 2024. ([giftster.com](https://www.giftster.com/advertising/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/tc/news-release/2024/08/07/2926263/0/en/Giftster-Announces-the-All-New-Android-Phone-Tablet-App-for-Sharing-Gift-Wish-Lists-Among-Family.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- Giftster\u2019s site and traffic estimates show the United States is its largest market, with sizable audiences in Canada, the UK and some European countries; Giftster states it has active members in ~40 countries. ([giftster.com](https://www.giftster.com/advertising/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [help.giftster.com](https://help.giftster.com/article/45-international-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [sem.jupiterseotool.com](https://sem.jupiterseotool.com/website/giftster.com/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nWhat we can infer (with assumptions)\n- Revenue: Giftster relies largely on affiliate/referral fees and limited advertising/partner deals. Using the $102M in partner-directed GMV (2024) and a plausible affiliate take-rate of 3\u20138% implies estimated gross revenue from affiliate/referral activity in the range of roughly $3M\u2013$8M for that activity alone (this is an estimate, not an official figure). Profitability cannot be determined from this alone because operating costs, other revenue streams, and margins are private. (I\u2019m making this inference from the cited GMV + typical affiliate rates; it should be verified with Giftster or a financial database for accuracy). ([giftster.com](https://www.giftster.com/advertising/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nMajor markets\n- Primary: United States (largest share of traffic and the company\u2019s stated majority audience).  \n- Secondary: Canada, United Kingdom, parts of Europe (traffic tools list Switzerland notably), and smaller pockets worldwide (Giftster claims activity in ~40 countries). ([sem.jupiterseotool.com](https://sem.jupiterseotool.com/website/giftster.com/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [help.giftster.com](https://help.giftster.com/article/45-international-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nIf you want exact revenue or profit figures I can:\n- Try to find interviews, press filings, or media reporting that cite company revenue or valuation (I\u2019ll search company registries and news).  \n- Or, if you prefer, I can build a short financial-estimate model using plausible affiliate rates, traffic-to-conversion assumptions, and subscription/other revenue scenarios \u2014 tell me which.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"while-working/product-mgmt/product-content/","title":"Product content notes","text":""},{"location":"while-working/product-mgmt/product-content/#resources","title":"Resources","text":""},{"location":"while-working/product-mgmt/product-content/#tofu-mofu-and-bofu","title":"TOFU, MOFU, and BOFU","text":"<p>https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/what-is-tofu-mofu-bofu</p>"},{"location":"while-working/product-mgmt/product-manager/","title":"As A Product Manager","text":"<p>Learning Material:</p> <ul> <li>udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-product-manager-learn-the-skills-get-a-job/</li> <li>https://productlogic.org/2014/09/13/the-product-triangle-a-visual-vocabulary-for-product-building/</li> <li>https://medium.com/earnest-product-management</li> <li>PM daily routine: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sachin-sharma-product-career-coach_careercoach-sachinsharma-productmanagers-activity-7327550621127966720-Rs0q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAADcnXwB2SGQ3YB0J31qjo1zUTB5LqDuqag</li> <li>Product manager interview guides:</li> <li>https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sachin-sharma-product-career-coach_google-career-skills-activity-7326463447863349248-xaAn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAADcnXwB2SGQ3YB0J31qjo1zUTB5LqDuqag</li> <li>https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sachin-sharma-product-career-coach_career-skills-interview-activity-7325376290356629504-uYIe?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAADcnXwB2SGQ3YB0J31qjo1zUTB5LqDuqag</li> <li>Free product management interviews: https://productschool.com/product-management-events</li> <li>Free product management e-books: https://productschool.com/resources/ebooks</li> <li>Blog to follow: https://productschool.com/blog</li> <li>PM's stakeholders : https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sachin-sharma-product-career-coach_productmanagement-careercoach-sachinsharma-activity-7321027648397213696-2ES9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAADcnXwB2SGQ3YB0J31qjo1zUTB5LqDuqag</li> <li>Hello PM curriculam: https://hellopm.co/#curriculum (price: 60k)</li> <li>product roadmapping microcertification: https://productschool.teachable.com/p/productroadmapping</li> <li>product manager certification by microsoft: https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-ai-product-manager#courses</li> <li>what is product intution: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saugatasingh_product-intuition-for-product-managers-activity-7358700889873833984-KgIg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAADcnXwB2SGQ3YB0J31qjo1zUTB5LqDuqag</li> </ul> <p>Roadmap examples:</p> <ul> <li>Very good OSS roadmap.

Two effective Roadmap types for this group are the Release Timeline and the Objectives Timeline. These formats can provide a strategic perspective, outlining how the product initiatives contribute to overarching objectives, without delving into granular details. Release Timeline, Objectives Timeline</p> </li> <li> <p>Customer-facing Teams: These teams, including sales, customer success, marketing, and support, need more detail to communicate effectively with prospects or customers. The Release Plan, supplemented with a Kanban or Status-based Roadmap, can be highly beneficial for these teams. These Roadmaps provide detailed insights into upcoming features and functionalities, enabling these teams to prepare internal and external materials and confidently answer customer queries about upcoming product enhancements. Release Plan, Release Timeline, Kanban/Status-based</p> </li> <li> <p>External Audiences: External customers generally appreciate a high-level product vision and near-term expected functionalities. Roadmap types similar to those used by Customer-facing teams can be suitable here. However, it's often best to provide summarized information and avoid committing to specific release timeframes to maintain trust and minimize potential frustrations. Examples of public opensource project roadmaps:</p> </li> <li> <p>GitHub roadmap: It is most detailed and well managed roadmap. Along with committed timelines and maximum details such as themes, product lines mentioned as labels. Even the feature descriptions are well writen.  See this microsoft AKS roadmap where they have not marked any features to a specific release. It is kanban/status-based board without timelines. It is also important to note that this is an open source product so it is even harder to commit timelines because contribution is done by contributors. Another example is VScode roadmap. Again a major open source project. It manages roadmap in a very different format. But again, doesn't give any timelines for features on a public roadmap to external audience. But surely, there would be more roadmaps managed internally for stackholders, paid customers etc. Release Plan, Kanban/Status-based</p> </li> <li> <p>Product Teams: These teams require granular information about what's being built, how it's being built, the required timeframe, and dependencies between functions and other teams. Several Roadmap types can meet these needs, including Now-Next-Later, Release Plans, Sprint Plans, and Kanban/Status-based formats. These Roadmaps aid in planning and execution, providing a clear direction for the product development process. Now-Next-Later, Release Plans, Sprint Plans, Kanban/Status-based</p> </li> <li> <p>Development Partners: For partners who need to align their development efforts with yours, a Release Timeline Roadmap is the most suitable.

This helps you group related ideas and spot high-frequency requests you might have missed.</p> <p>In MoSCoW, clustering helps you determine what truly qualifies as a Must-have vs. a Could-have. In RICE, identifying high-frequency requests improves your Reach input, giving you stronger signals about how many users are impacted. Example: AI reveals that \u201csync issues\u201d come up in 30% of support tickets. That strengthens its case as a Must-have or high-Reach item.  Effort Estimation Support AI models trained on internal engineering data can suggest effort ranges for new initiatives based on past work. This makes your scoring more consistent, especially when you\u2019re uncertain or lacking time.</p> <p>In RICE, it refines your Effort estimate. In Weighted Scoring, it can improve effort-related inputs like \u201cCost,\u201d \u201cComplexity,\u201d or \u201cTime to Build,\u201d depending on which criteria you\u2019ve included in your custom scorecard.  Example: AI analyzes similar backlog tickets and predicts the sync initiative will take 12 dev days. You now feel confident assigning a medium effort score.  Predictive Scoring and Pattern Matching</p> <p>Some AI tools go a step further and are able to analyze historical product decisions and business results to forecast which initiatives are likely to succeed. These aren\u2019t perfect, but they can help you sense-check your roadmap.</p> <p>In RICE, it can refine your Impact and Confidence inputs. In Weighted Scoring, it offers an early signal to adjust weights or reconsider assumptions. Example: AI flags that a feature similar to what you\u2019re considering (calendar integration) had low adoption last year. You lower your Impact or Confidence score accordingly.  Drafting and Communicating Priorities You can also use AI tools like ChatGPT to draft stakeholder updates, roadmap rationales, or internal documentation. This ensures clear, consistent messaging, especially when time is tight or you\u2019re juggling multiple requests.</p> <p>No matter which method you use, explaining your prioritization is key.  AI can help you articulate your logic and write clear summaries others can rally behind. \ud83d\udca1 More on communicating with confidence coming up in Module 4!</p> <p>Example: After scoring with Weighted Scoring, you use AI to generate a 1-slide summary explaining how each initiative ranked and why.</p> <p>As a PM, you may look at backlog items in 4 different categories:    -  tech debt: improved logging, reducing memory footprint   -  customer delight: UX improvements   -  feature requests: frequently requested feature on the user forums   -  strategic bets: new feature request from stackholders to expand into new markets</p>"},{"location":"while-working/product-mgmt/product-manager/#communication-to-get-buy-in","title":"Communication to get buy-in","text":"<p>Note: when prioritizing you have to gauge things like reach, impact, business value, must-have etc with respect to a feature.
