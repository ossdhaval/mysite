<p>Four stages of product lifecycle. </p>
<ul>
<li>introduction</li>
<li>Company has just introduced a new product. Need and the market for the product is still not proven</li>
<li>Only early adoptors are buying the product, so product is lossing money at this time due to little or no revenue</li>
<li>There are almost no or very few competitors in the market</li>
<li>growth</li>
<li>Products need and market has been proven to exist and consumers have accepted the product</li>
<li>Wider base of consumers are quickly buying the product. Product sees a rapid growth in revenue month on month or year on year. Revenue growth is a good indicator of product being in the growth phase.</li>
<li>Product starts to see new competition in the market with other players introducing similar products</li>
<li>maturity</li>
<li>product revenue peaks. The market is mature with lot of competitors. </li>
<li>decline</li>
<li>product revenue declines. Products can be phased out at this point, or relaunched with new features etc. Strategy may vary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="20">20<a class="headerlink" href="#20" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Product development process or lifecycle stages</p>
<ul>
<li>conceive</li>
<li>plan</li>
<li>develop</li>
<li>iterate</li>
<li>launch</li>
<li>steady</li>
<li>maintain or kill</li>
</ul>
<p>there is no definitive guide on how to tell in which phase your product is going through right now. There are only few characteristic of each phase by which you may be able to judge. There phases may also differe from product to product and market to market. </p>
<h2 id="25">25<a class="headerlink" href="#25" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>agile has two styles: scrum and kanban</p>
<p>kanban is different from scrum </p>
<ul>
<li>In Kanban doesn't timebox the work (as in 2 week or 4 week sprints). Kanban doesn't have sprints. Hence it doesn't have sprint backlog etc. But it has product backlog.</li>
<li>Kanban has not prescribed any meeting types. Like stand up meeting, sprint planning, retrospective etc.</li>
<li>In Kanban, the team should decide how many items can be in a particular state. For example, no more than 4 items in <code>in-progress</code> state.</li>
<li>Kanban is suited for the team working on items where estimates do not vary too much and hence the team keeps on moving items to completion one-after-another. For example, customer service team working on tickets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="30">30<a class="headerlink" href="#30" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sources of Ideas</li>
<li>Employees (yourself, co-workers, management)</li>
<li>Metrics (for example, pattern of UI usage)</li>
<li>Users (user feedback via forums, emails, complaints etc)</li>
<li>Clients (client feedback)</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between user vs client: </p>
<p>Client is someone who pays. The term users is a broader term which may refer to free users. For example, I am a user of gmail. But if I pay for google business suit, then I am google's client.</p>
<p>When product is a B2B product, you might have client and users in the same organization. For example, if citibank buys a software, the decision to buy and the payment comes from a director level person, but then the software gets used by someone who actually reports to him/her. So from a feedback perspective, you may get feedback from a different perspective from the director about your product, while the person who is actually using the product may also give you a different feedback.</p>
<h2 id="35">35<a class="headerlink" href="#35" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>compatitive market analysis: Question is that if the market that you are addressing is large enough to worth going into. This question comes when you are working on a feature or product that will put you in another market, or you are starting a fresh product.</p>
<p>There are two approaches to market sizing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top down</li>
<li>bottom up</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="top-down">Top down<a class="headerlink" href="#top-down" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Here you think about number of potential users first. Then target a market share that you can capture considering the current competition.</p>
<p>This is an optimistic approach. Not preferred if you have an option to do a bottom up approach.</p>
<p>For example: </p>
<p>Great question. Let’s take the <strong>same fitness app targeting urban millennials in the U.S.</strong> and apply a <strong>top-down market sizing approach</strong> instead.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="top-down-market-sizing-for-the-fitness-app"><strong>Top-Down Market Sizing for the Fitness App</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#top-down-market-sizing-for-the-fitness-app" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<h4 id="step-1-start-with-the-broad-market"><strong>Step 1: Start with the Broad Market</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-start-with-the-broad-market" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>Start with the <strong>total market size of the fitness and wellness industry</strong> in the U.S.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's say the U.S. fitness and wellness market is <strong>\$35 billion/year</strong> (based on industry reports).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-2-narrow-down-to-your-product-category"><strong>Step 2: Narrow Down to Your Product Category</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-narrow-down-to-your-product-category" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>You're in the <strong>digital fitness app</strong> sub-segment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital fitness is about <strong>10%</strong> of the total fitness market →
  \$35B × 10% = <strong>\$3.5 billion</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-3-narrow-further-by-demographic-geography"><strong>Step 3: Narrow Further by Demographic &amp; Geography</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-narrow-further-by-demographic-geography" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>You're targeting <strong>urban millennials</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Millennials make up \~22% of the U.S. population.</li>
<li>Urban population is \~83% of the U.S. population.</li>
<li>So, millennial urban share ≈ 22% × 83% ≈ <strong>18% of total U.S. population</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply that 18% to the digital fitness market:</p>
<ul>
<li>\$3.5B × 18% = <strong>\$630 million</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You might conservatively aim to capture <strong>5% of that segment</strong> over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>\$630M × 5% = <strong>\$31.5 million</strong> potential revenue for your app.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bottom-up">Bottom-up:<a class="headerlink" href="#bottom-up" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>Here you look at the current users base of your competition and see how much market share you can capture.</p>
<p>This approach is much more realistic because it looks at size of real users. Sizing using this approach takes more time. But it gives a conservative and more realistic number which is better than optimistic sizing using top down.</p>
<p><strong>example of bottom up sizing:</strong></p>
<p>Sure! Here's a different example of the <strong>bottom-up market sizing</strong> approach, this time for a <strong>subscription-based fitness app</strong> targeting urban millennials in the U.S.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="scenario"><strong>Scenario</strong>:<a class="headerlink" href="#scenario" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>You’re launching a fitness app that costs <strong>\$15 per month</strong>, and you want to estimate the market size using a bottom-up approach.</p>

<ul>
<li>Target: Urban millennials (aged 25–40) in the U.S.</li>
<li>According to census data, there are about <strong>72 million millennials</strong> in the U.S.</li>
<li>Let’s assume <strong>60% live in urban areas</strong> → <strong>43.2 million</strong> people.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-estimate-adoption-rate"><strong>2. Estimate Adoption Rate</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#2-estimate-adoption-rate" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Not everyone will subscribe to a fitness app.</li>
<li>Assume a realistic <strong>penetration rate of 5%</strong> based on competition and behavior trends →
  <strong>5% of 43.2 million = 2.16 million potential users</strong></li>

<p>Product market sizing is the process of estimating the potential value or volume of a market for a particular product or service. There are several common methods to approach market sizing, broadly categorized into <strong>top-down</strong>, <strong>bottom-up</strong>, and <strong>value-theory-based</strong> approaches. Here's a breakdown:</p>
<h5 id="3-value-theory-or-economic-value-based-sizing">3. <strong>Value-Theory (or Economic-Value) Based Sizing</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#3-value-theory-or-economic-value-based-sizing" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<p>This approach estimates how much value your product creates and how much customers might be willing to pay based on that.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Steps</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the value your product adds (time saved, revenue increased, cost saved).</p>
</li>
<li>Estimate how much of that value you can capture through pricing.</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by the number of target customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:
  If your tool saves a business \$10,000/year and you're pricing at \$2,000/year, and there are 5,000 businesses, market size = \$10M.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Useful for new or disruptive products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>: Assumes value perception aligns with pricing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h5 id="4-comparables-approach">4. <strong>Comparables Approach</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#4-comparables-approach" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<p>Use similar businesses or products to estimate your own market size.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Steps</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify analog companies or markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjust for differences in geography, market maturity, price points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:
  If a competitor has \$100M revenue in a market you’re entering and you're targeting 10% of their segment, your opportunity might be \$10M.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Quick and practical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>: May overlook uniqueness of your product or market.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h5 id="5-customer-surveys-and-primary-research">5. <strong>Customer Surveys and Primary Research</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#5-customer-surveys-and-primary-research" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<p>Gather data directly from potential customers to estimate market size.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Steps</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Survey or interview potential buyers about willingness to pay and usage.</p>
</li>
<li>Extrapolate to broader population.</li>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: Customized, direct feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: Costly, can have sample bias.</li>

<ol>
<li>Known competitors:</li>
<li>based on your experience with the product and domain, you already know who your primary competitors are. Every product manager should know this. It is essential.</li>
<li>feature competitors: not all competitors have the same set of features. So, if your focus is on a feature of your product, for example, cedarling (a embedable, light weight PDP), then you need to know which of your competitors have features that solve the same problem.</li>
<li>Unknown competitors:</li>
<li>When you are building a new feature or a new product altogether. Also, for an existing product the competetors keep on changing (companies shutdown, new companies come up, existing competitors may change the direction) etc, you should periodically survey the current competition state.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="looking-for-unknown-competitors">Looking for unknown competitors<a class="headerlink" href="#looking-for-unknown-competitors" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>google search for <code>&lt;your product name&gt; versus</code>. And google will suggest most likely searches. with possible names. This is because people have searched for it. But this will only be helpful if your product is well known.</li>
<li>You can do a chatgpt search</li>
<li>search for what your product is e.g <code>embedable PDP</code></li>
<li>search reddit, twitter etc for what user issue your product solves. You may find users that are complaining about the same thing and other suggesting them products that solve that problem.</li>
<li>check sites like below and look for alternatives of a product or product category.</li>

<ul>
<li>Direct</li>
<li>Products that solve the same problem as your product</li>
<li>They solve the same problem in the same way</li>
<li>They solve the same problem in the same way for the same set of market or geography</li>
<li>Example: Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) is Gluu's direct competitor. RH-SSO is built on top of Keycloak which is OSS, just like Flex is built on top of Janssen Server.</li>
<li>Action item for PM: Keep a close eye on roadmap of such products and feature releases of such products and company news. What features are being developed, released, how are they marketing their product, where are they marketing their product, their market share movements, leadership changes, acquisitions etc.</li>
<li>Indirect</li>
<li>Products that solve same problem but in a different way and may be for a different user market. Their market could be superset of yours or a subset or may be having a little bit of overlap.</li>
<li>Example:</li>
<li>Action item for PM: You shouldn't be losing too many customers to these competitors.</li>
<li>Potential</li>
<li>companies that have a product that solves a different problem but it is in the same domain as yours. They serve the same set of market (customer group). They could expand their portfolio and add a new product with competing features as your product and then they can potentially become a direct competetor.</li>
<li>Example: <code>https://www.cerbos.dev/</code> is a company that provides authorization software. But they could potentially add authentication features and become a direct competetors.</li>
<li>Action item for PM: Add features that these competitors can't add easily in your core domain area.</li>
<li>Substitute</li>
<li>solves the same problem but doesn't deliver to the same people in the same way and it is far from what you are offering to the market.</li>
<li>For instance, gluu offers IAM software which is backed by a core team and an enterprise support plan. Substitute could be an opensource IAM repository in the GitHub which doesn't have any sponsor or a company backing it with an enterprise plan. Yes, it may provide the same function and large enterprises can use it as their IAM server but it is not the same as Gluu.</li>
<li>Action item for PM: Be better then these in solving the problem. Meaning feature parity perspective.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Need to closely monitor and watch your competetors. On following criterias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>product core (product team):</p>
<ul>
<li>better team can out pace you in feature delivery, out engineer you by building better and stable product. If you have a team with much lower quality than your competitor, then features and markets won't matter. Features that depend on high quality engineering are difficult to imitate by your competetors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>user base size:<ul>
<li>Companies with large user base(e.g microsoft) have certain advantages</li>
<li>New product and feature launches are easier get initial set of users. As existing customers would easily adopt those new features.</li>
<li>publicity: new products and new features from a company with large user base get more publicity quickly. Content creators and early adoptors start             immediately talking about those things.</li>
<li>. Easier to make deals with other companies and have collaboration and integrations:</li>
<li>For a product with large userbase, other companies will readily agree to create integrations and collaborations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design<ul>
<li>Be aware of competetor's ability to design an intuitive user experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brand<ul>
<li>A company's brand can give them advantage in certain markets while it will be of disadvantage in other markets. Like for example, Sony as a brand can easily make and sell kitchen appliences if they wanted to. But Mercedese which is known only for cars will find it difficult to get into kitchen appliences market. Same thing with Sony, it'll hard to get into making cars.</li>
<li>At the same time, apple could move easily from making Phone to making watches. This is because their brand stands for inituitively designed and high quality consumer goods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speed<ul>
<li>Understand the speed at which your competetor can move to build a new feature in the product. Generally, larget companies are slower that smaller companies. In case of opensource products, you can check your competetor's GH account and see how long an new feature request takes to compete.</li>

<li>One critical aspect in any prioritization/roadmap effort is to estimate business value of the feature. A feature's value can be derived by considering two factors:</li>
<li>Value offered to users: The value an initiative will deliver to your user personas or your market more broadly. This type of value would include, for example, the degree to which your initiative will reduce users’ pain or improve their efficiency, and how urgently your market seems to be demanding it.</li>
<li>Value offered to the business: An estimation of the initiative’s direct business value to your company. This value might be reflected in terms of acquiring new customers, retaining existing customers, the ability to upsell customers, and the anticipated new revenue the initiative will bring.</li>

<li>UX: UX is the experience that a person gets while using the product. Each person would feel(expereince) the same product differently based on what they value. A sports car's experience would be fantastic to a person who loves thrills and speed. While Same sports car would be experienced differently by someone who has been troumatized by a recent car accident. So, it is not the design of the car that is at fault. It is knowing what is the value that user is seeking from the product.</li>
<li>How user experiences the product is also dependent on under what circumstances that product is being used. High pressure, leisure etc.</li>

<p>Few well known metrics:</p>
<p>Revenue,
MRR : monthly recurring revenue (imp for SaaS)
ARPU: average revenue per user
DAU: Daily active users
  - DAU's definition can be specific to each company. For example, Facebook may consider a user as an active user if the user has spent 5 minutes on the facebook. While Netflix may decide to call a user active only if they have watched content for 20 minutes. Flipkart may only call a user active if they have put something in the cart. </p>

<li>What is a product roadmap?
  Product roadmap is a communication and collaboration tool. With primarily 3 consumers of it. The product team, business and customers. Roadmap is used by these three stackholders to understand different things.</li>
<li>Product team: what needs to be build and when (priority)</li>
<li>Business: How efforts will align to gain business values</li>
<li>customer: how product will deliver value to customers in terms of useful features and fixes</li>
<li>Roadmap as part of the culture</li>
<li>Roadmap should be a central piece where all 3 stakeholders of the product collaborate and come to know the real picture. You need to build a culture in the company that refer to product roadmap to collaborate on delivering features, priorities, values. Hence, It is important that product roadmap is dependable. To make it dependeble, refer to avoid the difficulties listed below.</li>
<li>
<p>Roadmap needs these as input: product vision, and product objectives to realize that vision. These two will guide product roadmap to correctly identify and prioritize features. Product vision provides the direction while the objectives tell you how to move in that direction. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Difficulties with a product roadmap</p>
</li>
<li>People find it hard to keep the product roadmap updated. If not updated frequently, slowly it loses it's importance and it is then updated only when it needs to be presented to someone. Just for namesake.</li>
<li>Product roadmap should be balanced with details. Not too detailed and not too high level. If it is too high level then it loses the value for product teams. At the same time, if it is too detailed, then the business stackholders and customers will get drowned in the details. </li>
<li>Organisations may lack futuristic long term view. Or may lack clearly definded product vision, strategy and business values to achieve. These things are input into creating a meaningful roadmap. Without these a roadmap will not be able to priorise or de-prioritise competing features. </li>
<li>Organisations may have other driving factors like regulatory, budgetory etc which make it hard to create a long term plan and hence creating roadmap for a very short term is not so useful.</li>
<li>
<p>If business has frequently changing priorities then product roadmap would be changing too often. That also makes it unreliable. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What product roadmaps are made up of?</p>

<h2 id="prioritization-and-planning">prioritization and planning<a class="headerlink" href="#prioritization-and-planning" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Prioritization process of grooming feature with following details:
- Voice of customer (notes, positive/negative, align notes with features and finally deriving <code>customer importance score</code>)
- Voice of product team (capture RICE(reach, impact, confidence, effort) for each feature and derive a rice score from that)
- voice of business
  - Business value on the prioritization board is represented by adding <code>segments</code> that we want to grow in.
  - A segment field will show a score that is derived using the <code>segment</code> - <code>company</code> - <code>feature feedback</code> connection
  - How segment - company are connected? There are two ways in Productboard to do so. One is automatic where rules are manually defined (say a company with greater revenue than 10000 should be aligned to <code>enterprise</code> segment) while creating a segment. Company and revenue data comes via Salesforce integration.
  - How feature feedback - company are connectd? This is done via notes in the <code>insights</code> section. Insight section essentially pulls all the data from email, slack and other customer communication channels. Then you can manually read the notes and link them to features. Also, each note can be annotated with importance score and positive/negative/neutral sentiment. Using all this data, you know what feature is important for a customer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritization board should be different from planning board</li>
<li>You prepare prioritization board first to groom the features. Then create a copy of that board and call it quaterly planning board. And remove some of the columns which are not needed anymore (like individual columns for RICE. But only keep the final RICE score column). Add new columns to denote Quaterly(or any other) releases.</li>

<li>After the prioritization and planning has been done, it is time to create different views of the same roadmap. Each view is tailored for audience below.</li>
<li>Product team<ul>
<li>Product roadmap for product teams should be detailed one. Because they are going to base their development priorities on this roadmap.</li>
<li>Info to include: Detailed effort estimates of features, timelines, customer impact, confidence levels etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business leadership team<ul>
<li>From roadmap they want to understand if the efforts are being spent towards the strategic direction of the product or company.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>External audience<ul>
<li>External audience groups consists of customers, investors, partners</li>
<li>info to include: forward looking information like feature delivery quarters, when features will be available in beta, themes that you are going to deliver your features on.</li>
<li>Here it is not important to show exact delivery timelines. That detail will confuse this audience. Similarly, things like effort estimates should not be in this view of the roadmap.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Customer facing teams<ul>
<li>These teams are sales, support, customer success, Go-to-market etc. They will look at the roadmap to get answers to questions like <code>what can I tell to the customer about availability of this feature</code>, <code>which customer feedbacks are being targetted by features</code>, <code>Are we working on features to improve maintainebility and supportability of the product?</code> etc.</li>

<p>Each Roadmap format serves a unique purpose and is suited to different communication needs. The choice of Roadmap depends on the nature of your project, the audience you're communicating with, and the level of detail you wish to provide. Properly utilized, these Roadmap formats can significantly enhance your product planning and communication processes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Release plans (Granularity: feature(i.e epic) level)</li>
<li>shows features(epics) planned per release</li>
<li>doesn't show exact release dates to reduce the clutter and to accomodate the fact that release dates may change</li>
<li>Sprint plans (Granularity: user story level)</li>
<li>used to run sprints</li>
<li>more granular where dates are tracked at the userstory level </li>
<li>primarily used by development org</li>
<li>now-next-later (Granularity: feature(i.e epic) level)</li>
<li>used to show what features are being worked on right now, what comes after that and what is in the <code>later</code> bucket.</li>
<li>This allows to show how features are prioritized without showing releases or timelines</li>
<li>Kanban/status based roadmaps (Granularity: feature(i.e epic) level)</li>
<li>This is more of an detailed view of <code>now</code> part of the <code>now-next-later</code> roadmap. </li>
<li>unlike sprint plan, This shows features in various stage of development and doesn't go to the userstory level</li>
<li>Timeline based roadmaps</li>
<li>These are detailed version of <code>now-next-later</code> roadmaps where features that are being worked and when they are going to be delivered with dates</li>
<li>If you choose to show dates for features coming up <code>later</code> (i.e far future), it is important to make sure to communicate the fact that those may change. Otherwise, external partners, development partners, customers may start banking on those dates.</li>
<li>Timeline-based Roadmaps can be further categorized based on their focus. These are:<ul>
<li>Features Timeline: Focusing on when features will be developed and launched, this Roadmap helps internal teams plan and communicate upcoming releases and allows customers to anticipate what's next. Due to its granular nature, it's best used for high-certainty planning.</li>
<li>Objectives Timeline: Focusing on achieving specific objectives over time, this Roadmap emphasizes the "why" over the "what." Depending on communication needs, you can include aligned features or just the objectives.</li>
<li>Release Timeline: Similar to Release Plans, this Roadmap visually depicts when different product versions or updates are planned for release, giving stakeholders an overview of the product's future.</li>

<p>When it comes to choosing Roadmap types, it's essential to consider the needs of different audience groups within your organization:</p>
<p>Note: release roadmap and release timeline roadmaps are different. The later one has timelines details available. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Leadership: This group is typically interested in a high-level view of the product team's work, aligned with the company or product objectives. Two effective Roadmap types for this group are the Release Timeline and the Objectives Timeline. These formats can provide a strategic perspective, outlining how the product initiatives contribute to overarching objectives, without delving into granular details.
<em>Release Timeline, Objectives Timeline</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer-facing Teams: These teams, including sales, customer success, marketing, and support, need more detail to communicate effectively with prospects or customers. The Release Plan, supplemented with a Kanban or Status-based Roadmap, can be highly beneficial for these teams. These Roadmaps provide detailed insights into upcoming features and functionalities, enabling these teams to prepare internal and external materials and confidently answer customer queries about upcoming product enhancements.
<em>Release Plan, Release Timeline, Kanban/Status-based</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>External Audiences: External customers generally appreciate a high-level product vision and near-term expected functionalities. Roadmap types similar to those used by Customer-facing teams can be suitable here. However, it's often best to provide summarized information and avoid committing to specific release timeframes to maintain trust and minimize potential frustrations.
Examples of public opensource project roadmaps:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub roadmap: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247">It is</a> most detailed and well managed roadmap. Along with committed timelines and maximum details such as themes, product lines mentioned as labels. Even the feature descriptions are well writen. 
See this <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Azure/projects/685/views/1">microsoft AKS roadmap</a> where they have not marked any features to a specific release. It is kanban/status-based board without timelines. It is also important to note that this is an open source product so it is even harder to commit timelines because contribution is done by contributors. Another example is <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap">VScode roadmap</a>. Again a major open source project. It manages roadmap in a very different format. But again, doesn't give any timelines for features on a public roadmap to external audience. But surely, there would be more roadmaps managed internally for stackholders, paid customers etc.
<em>Release Plan, Kanban/Status-based</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Product Teams: These teams require granular information about what's being built, how it's being built, the required timeframe, and dependencies between functions and other teams. Several Roadmap types can meet these needs, including Now-Next-Later, Release Plans, Sprint Plans, and Kanban/Status-based formats. These Roadmaps aid in planning and execution, providing a clear direction for the product development process.
Now-Next-Later, Release Plans, Sprint Plans, Kanban/Status-based</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development Partners: For partners who need to align their development efforts with yours, a Release Timeline Roadmap is the most suitable. This Roadmap shows when different product versions or updates are planned, enabling partners to coordinate their efforts accordingly.
<em>Release Timeline Roadmap</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, while these are common examples, every audience and organization has unique needs. The key is to identify your different audiences and select the Roadmap type that best represents the information they need. This will ensure effective communication and alignment across all stakeholders, contributing to successful product development and delivery.</p>

<p>Prioritization is about focusing your team’s energy on the initiatives that will have the greatest impact.</p>
<p>Prioritization helps you stay confident about delivering value and not get swayed by the loudest stackholder or latest market trend.</p>
<h3 id="ruthless-prioritization">Ruthless prioritization<a class="headerlink" href="#ruthless-prioritization" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>One concept you’ll often encounter in product management is ruthless prioritization. This means saying “no” to certain ideas (even good ones!) to protect your product’s focus and ensure the most valuable work gets done first.</p>
<p>As Sheryl Sandberg, former Chief Operating Officer at Meta, explains, ruthless prioritization means making deliberate, sometimes tough choices about what goes on the product roadmap—and just as importantly, what doesn’t. It’s about focusing on the initiatives that truly matter rather than spreading your resources across everything that “could” be done.</p>
<h4 id="why-its-important-to-say-no"><strong>Why It's Important to Say "No"</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#why-its-important-to-say-no" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Resource Realities</li>
</ul>
<p>As a Product Manager, you're constantly working within constraints—limited time, limited budget, and a finite team's bandwidth. Saying “yes” to everything stretches those resources too thin. The result? Delayed timelines, rushed features, or work that doesn’t meet the bar. Prioritization is about protecting focus and ensuring that what does move forward gets the attention it needs to be high-quality and truly impactful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Value First</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all requests are equal. Some features might sound exciting or come from influential stakeholders, but if they don’t meaningfully move the needle for your users or your business, they’re not worth the investment. Saying “no” to lower-impact ideas allows you to say “yes” to the ones that matter most. It’s all about being intentional, not rigid.</p>
<h4 id="saying-no-doesnt-mean-youre-dismissive"><strong>Saying "No" Doesn't Mean You're Dismissive</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#saying-no-doesnt-mean-youre-dismissive" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Clarity Over Rejection</li>
</ul>
<p>Declining a request doesn’t mean disregarding the person who suggested it. In fact, the way you say ‘no’ may actually strengthen your relationships. When you can explain your reasoning, whether it’s tied to user research, alignment with company goals, or current technical constraints, you show that your decisions are thoughtful, not arbitrary. That’s the kind of clarity that builds trust for future projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>"No" Doesn't Mean "Never"</li>
</ul>
<p>A lower-priority request today might rise in importance tomorrow. New data, evolving customer needs, or strategic shifts can quickly change what’s worth building. Be sure to document these decisions and remain open to re-evaluation. This will help you stay agile without losing sight of what matters most right now.</p>
<p>In 1997, when steve jobs came back to Apple, a loss making company at that time, He famously slashed the product lineup from around fifteen different models to just four primary categories: a consumer desktop, a consumer laptop, a professional desktop, and a professional laptop. This wasn't just a matter of reducing numbers to bring costs down; it was about making hard decisions and eliminating distractions so the company could regain its focus. Jobs' vision for Apple was clear: by focusing on a smaller set of products, the company could make a real impact, which would drive long-term success.</p>
<p>While ruthless prioritization is essential, that doesn’t mean the answer is always “no.”</p>
<p>Great Product Managers also know when to say “yes”—and here’s a hint: it’s not about pleasing everyone. Fundamentally, it’s about recognizing when a feature aligns with your product’s goals, users’ needs, and the company’s long-term vision.</p>
<p><strong>Signals when you should say <code>yes</code>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Significant Customer Impact</li>
</ul>
<p>If a key customer, especially one that contributes meaningfully to your revenue, requests a feature that would improve their experience or prevent churn, it’s worth considering. Losing that customer could have ripple effects beyond just lost income, including internal stakeholder pressure or reputational risk.</p>
<ul>
<li>Common Customer Issue</li>
</ul>
<p>When multiple customers raise the same issue or ask for similar functionality, it often signals a broader need. But don’t jump straight to “yes.” Validate the pattern, check if it aligns with your product strategy, and determine whether solving it will improve the experience for a meaningful portion of your user base.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opportunity for Market Expansion</li>
</ul>
<p>Some requests do more than just serve existing customers—they unlock new use cases or attract new segments. If a feature has the potential to open the door to a new market or strengthen your competitive edge, it may carry long-term strategic value.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prerequisite for Future Development</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, a request may not feel high-impact on its own, but it lays the groundwork for something bigger. Think of it as an enabler, a building block that allows your team to deliver more valuable functionality down the line.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aligned with Company Capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every good idea is right for your team to execute. Before saying “yes,” make sure the request is feasible within your current capabilities, whether that’s technical expertise, budget, timeline, or business model. The best feature ideas are the ones you can execute well and sustainably.</p>
<p><strong>So—what is prioritization really all about?</strong></p>
<p>It’s about making intentional choices in a world of competing demands. Every decision to prioritize one feature over another involves trade-offs: speed vs. impact, user needs vs. business goals, and short-term wins vs. long-term vision.</p>
<h3 id="prioritization-frameworks">Prioritization frameworks<a class="headerlink" href="#prioritization-frameworks" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<h4 id="moscow">MoSCoW<a class="headerlink" href="#moscow" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>MoSCoW is one of the simplest and most widely used prioritization frameworks in product management. 
It helps you sort features, ideas, or requests into four clear categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Must-haves: Critical to success. The product can’t function without these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should-haves: Valuable, but not essential. Can be postponed without major risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could-haves: Nice-to-haves. Low-priority items that only make the cut if there’s extra time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Won’t-haves (for now): Explicitly deprioritized to keep focus on what matters most.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to Use MoSCoW</strong></p>
<p>It’s a great fit for prioritizing:</p>
<p>✍️ Scoping a release or MVP: When you need to decide what’s absolutely required to ship.
✍️ Backlog grooming: When your list of ideas is long and time is short.
✍️ Sprint or planning meetings: When you need agreement on what the team should work on next.
✍️ Early-stage product work: When there’s limited data, but decisions still need to be made.</p>
<p>Part of what makes MoSCoW work well with cross-functional groups is its ability to structure the conversation without getting overly technical, especially when not everyone has a product background. MoSCoW is a qualitative approach and not quantitative as it depends on individual judgement and not data. </p>
<p><strong>How MoSCoW Works in Practice</strong></p>
<p>MoSCoW is often run as a collaborative exercise. You can do it in a shared document, with a whiteboard, or via virtual tools like Miro, Mural, FigJam, or Notion.</p>
<p>Start by listing all current ideas, requests, or features. Then sort each into one of the four categories.</p>
<p>Once that’s done, ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are there too many “Musts”?</li>
<li>Can we downgrade any “Shoulds”?</li>
<li>What are we confident saying “No” to (for now)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>You're scoping your MVP. "Login" and "core task flow" go in Must-have. A “dark mode toggle” goes in Could-have. And that complex calendar sync? It’s a Won’t-have...at least for this release.</p>

<h4 id="rice">RICE<a class="headerlink" href="#rice" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>Unlike MoSCoW, which is a fast, qualitative approach, RICE adds structure by using a simple formula to score and compare initiatives. It helps product teams evaluate different types of work on a more objective scale, using four factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reach: How many users will this initiative affect in a given time period?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impact: How much will it move the needle on user behavior, satisfaction, or business goals?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confidence: How certain are you about the reach and impact estimates?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effort: How much time or work will it take to build?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>calculation of RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort</p>
<p><strong>When to Use RICE</strong></p>
<p>RICE is especially useful when you're dealing with a long list of ideas and need a consistent, objective way to weigh them, especially when team opinions differ or resources are tight. While it’s not perfect, it helps remove some of the emotion or gut instinct from prioritization and replaces it with logic that teams can align around.</p>
<p>It’s useful for prioritizing:</p>
<p>✍️ Competing priorities that all seem valuable: It brings clarity to decisions that might otherwise come down to opinion.
✍️ New roadmap or sprint cycle planning: RICE can help surface the highest-impact, lowest-effort opportunities.
✍️ How to justify your choices to stakeholders: The numbers provide a simple, shareable rationale for what’s getting prioritized and why.
✍️ Where to reduce bias: It forces teams to articulate assumptions about value and effort, which can reveal blind spots or overconfidence.</p>
<p>You don’t need perfect data to use RICE. In fact, even rough estimates are helpful. What matters most is that you apply the same logic across each option.</p>
<p><strong>How RICE Works in Practice</strong></p>
<p>Each factor in the RICE framework is given a numeric estimate based on available data or team judgment. Just remember, it’s not about precision, it’s about consistent, directional scoring.</p>
<p>Here’s how each input typically works:</p>
<p><strong>Reach</strong>: How many users will this affect? (e.g., 500 users/30%)
This is scored as either a number or a total percent of the user base</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: How much will the initiative move the needle on user behavior or business goals? (e.g. 2)
This is rated on a 3-point scale: 3 = high, 2 = medium, 1 = low, 0.5 = minimal)</p>
<p><strong>Confidence</strong>: How sure are you about your reach and impact values? (e.g., 80%)
This is expressed as a %, based on how sure you are.</p>
<p><strong>Effort</strong>: How much time will it take to complete? (e.g., 5)
This is a rough estimate in person-days or “small/medium/large,” converted to numbers like 2 (quick win), 5 (moderate effort), or 8+ (big lift).</p>
<p>💡<strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say you’re comparing two initiatives: improving user onboarding and adding a new feature. For onboarding, you estimate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reach = 500 users</li>
<li>Impact = 3 (high)</li>
<li>Confidence = 80% (0.8)</li>
<li>Effort = 5</li>
</ol>
<p>RICE Score = (500 × 3 × 0.8) ÷ 5 = 240</p>
<p>As a comparative, the RICE score of the new feature initiative might be lower due to the higher effort required and lower confidence in its execution.</p>
<p>RICE Pros and Cons
After walking through how RICE helps quantify trade-offs, let’s explore where it shines and where it may require more nuance or setup to be effective.</p>
<p>|Pros   | Cons|
|Brings structure to prioritization: Helps remove bias and emotional decision-making.   | Requires at least some data: Harder to apply when you have little user or usage info. |
|Useful for long lists of ideas: Makes it easier to compare multiple initiatives at once. | Estimates can feel subjective: Scores are only as reliable as the assumptions behind them.|
|Makes trade-offs visible: Helps teams think critically about effort vs. impact.    | Can give a false sense of precision: A higher score doesn’t always mean a better decision. |
|Supports stakeholder communication: Provides a transparent rationale behind choices.   | More time-consuming than lightweight frameworks: Not ideal for rapid decision-making.|</p>
<h4 id="weighted-scoring">Weighted scoring<a class="headerlink" href="#weighted-scoring" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>(good for representing trade-offs between high-level initiatives and prioritising them)</p>
<p>Weighted Scoring is a customizable prioritization framework that helps you evaluate and compare initiatives based on the factors that matter most to your product, team, or business. Unlike MoSCoW or RICE, it gives you full control over the criteria you evaluate and how much influence each one should have.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70815ff2-4fba-488d-a1fc-8d248809719a" /></p>
<p><strong>When to Use Weighted Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Weighted Scoring works best when you’re faced with multiple initiatives that all seem important, and you need to make a confident, transparent decision. Because it forces teams to clarify what matters most, it’s particularly valuable when you’re balancing strategic priorities, working across cross-functional teams, or need to justify trade-offs to stakeholders.</p>
<p>It’s especially useful for prioritizing:</p>
<p>✍️ Strategic roadmap planning: It helps to evaluate big bets or initiatives with long-term implications.
✍️ Cross-functional trade-offs: It provides a common language when product, design, and engineering need to make decisions together.
✍️ Stakeholder alignment and presentation: It helps provide evidence when you need to defend or explain prioritization decisions.
✍️ Resource-constrained environments: It clearly demonstrates where it’s critical to invest time and energy, and where it counts most.</p>
<p><strong>How Weighted Scoring Works in Practice</strong></p>
<p>To apply Weighted Scoring effectively, you’ll need a consistent way to rate each initiative against your chosen criteria. One simple and accessible approach is to use a nonlinear scale, such as 0, 1, 3, 7, and 10. This allows you to reflect meaningful differences without getting stuck in precision.</p>
<p>Here’s how to put it into action:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start with your list of initiatives
These could be features, fixes, experiments, or anything you're considering for the roadmap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose your evaluation criteria
Decide what to evaluate ideas against based on your goals. Some common examples include:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Value to Customers: How much will this help your users? Will it solve a meaningful problem or significantly improve the experience?
Risk: How uncertain is the outcome? Consider technical unknowns, delivery complexity, or business risk.
Effort: How much time and work will this take? Higher effort typically lowers priority, unless the payoff is worth it.
3. ⚠️ A quick note on risk and effort
Since high risk and high effort are typically less desirable, you’ll assign negative weights to those criteria. That way, a high score (e.g., 10 for "very risky") reduces the overall priority instead of increasing it. You don’t need to reverse your scoring—the negative weight does the work for you. This lets you use the same 0–10 scale across all criteria while keeping the math aligned with intelligent trade-offs.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Assign weights to each criterion
If user value is more important than effort or risk, give it a higher percentage. Your weights should total 100%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Score each initiative
To evaluate how each initiative performs on each criterion, apply a consistent scale (like the 0, 1, 3, 7, or 10 mentioned earlier). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate and compare
Multiply the score by the weight for each criterion, then add up the results. The higher the total, the higher the priority.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>💡<strong>EXAMPLE:</strong>
You’re evaluating an initiative to fix a sync issue in your calendar planner app. The team agrees on the following evaluation weights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Value = 50% (0.5)</li>
<li>Risk = -30% (-0.3)</li>
<li>Effort = -20% (-0.2)</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's how you might score it:
1. Value = 7: It solves a known pain point for a wide user segment
2. Risk: 1: It's technically straightforward with minimal unknowns
3. Effort: 3: It's a moderate lift that can be handled within a sprint</p>
<p>Now apply the formula:
1. 7 x 0.5 = 3.5
2. 1 x -0.3 = -0.3
3. 3 x -0.2 = -0.6
Final Score = 3.5 - 0.3 - 0.6 = 2.6</p>
<p>This initiative is high—value, low-risk, and manageable in scope. The final score helps the team see it as a smart, high-priority opportunity.</p>
<p>|Pros   | Cons|
|Custom-fit to your context: You define the criteria and weights based on what matters most to your team and product.   | Takes time to set up: Requires upfront effort to define scoring rules and agree on weights.|
|Great for stakeholder alignment: Makes trade-offs visible and brings structure to cross-functional prioritization conversations.   | Still subjective: Even with a system, people may score things differently—and that’s okay.|
|Backs up your strategy: Helps you clearly communicate why you're prioritizing one initiative over another. | Looks more precise than it is: The math can feel official, but the inputs are still based on human judgment.|</p>

<h3 id="how-ai-tools-can-help-in-prioritization">How AI tools can help in prioritization<a class="headerlink" href="#how-ai-tools-can-help-in-prioritization" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Here are a few powerful ways to bring AI into your prioritization process within the three frameworks you’ve just learned:</p>
<p>Idea Clustering and Theme Detection
AI tools can analyze user feedback, support tickets, survey responses, and product reviews to automatically surface common themes or pain points. This helps you group related ideas and spot high-frequency requests you might have missed.</p>
<p>In MoSCoW, clustering helps you determine what truly qualifies as a Must-have vs. a Could-have.
In RICE, identifying high-frequency requests improves your Reach input, giving you stronger signals about how many users are impacted.
Example: AI reveals that “sync issues” come up in 30% of support tickets. That strengthens its case as a Must-have or high-Reach item.
 Effort Estimation Support
AI models trained on internal engineering data can suggest effort ranges for new initiatives based on past work. This makes your scoring more consistent, especially when you’re uncertain or lacking time.</p>
<p>In RICE, it refines your Effort estimate.
In Weighted Scoring, it can improve effort-related inputs like “Cost,” “Complexity,” or “Time to Build,” depending on which criteria you’ve included in your custom scorecard. 
Example: AI analyzes similar backlog tickets and predicts the sync initiative will take 12 dev days. You now feel confident assigning a medium effort score.
 Predictive Scoring and Pattern Matching</p>
<p>Some AI tools go a step further and are able to analyze historical product decisions and business results to forecast which initiatives are likely to succeed. These aren’t perfect, but they can help you sense-check your roadmap.</p>
<p>In RICE, it can refine your Impact and Confidence inputs.
In Weighted Scoring, it offers an early signal to adjust weights or reconsider assumptions.
Example: AI flags that a feature similar to what you’re considering (calendar integration) had low adoption last year. You lower your Impact or Confidence score accordingly.
 Drafting and Communicating Priorities
You can also use AI tools like ChatGPT to draft stakeholder updates, roadmap rationales, or internal documentation. This ensures clear, consistent messaging, especially when time is tight or you’re juggling multiple requests.</p>
<p>No matter which method you use, explaining your prioritization is key. 
AI can help you articulate your logic and write clear summaries others can rally behind.
💡 More on communicating with confidence coming up in Module 4!</p>
<p>Example: After scoring with Weighted Scoring, you use AI to generate a 1-slide summary explaining how each initiative ranked and why.</p>
<p>As a PM, you may look at backlog items in 4 different categories: 
  -  tech debt: improved logging, reducing memory footprint
  -  customer delight: UX improvements
  -  feature requests: frequently requested feature on the user forums
  -  strategic bets: new feature request from stackholders to expand into new markets</p>
<h2 id="communication-to-get-buy-in">Communication to get buy-in<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-to-get-buy-in" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: when prioritizing you have to gauge things like reach, impact, business value, must-have etc with respect to a feature. At this point understand the difference between <code>opinion</code> vs <code>data-driven judgement</code>. Try to give a <code>data-driven jugdgement</code> as much as possible. Try to find data from your own product. If not possible then try to find data from market and competitor products. Some relevant data is better than a personal opinion. This will be evident when you communicate your prioritization to the stakeholders and broader teams.</p>
<p>product team does something critical: they didn’t just share what they prioritized, they explained why. They walked stakeholders through their decision-making framework, explained how each initiative had been scored, and made the trade-offs clear.</p>
<p>Bring others along in your prioritization journey, whether it’s your designers, engineers, executives, or customers. </p>
<p><strong>Product success isn’t just about what you build; it’s about how well you help others see why it matters.</strong></p>
<p>How to communicate your roadmaps and prioritization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain Your Logic Clearly (Even If It’s Not Perfect)</li>
</ul>
<p>People don’t need every detail. In fact, that may just bog them down. But they do need to see your thought process.</p>
<p>Try this:
  Use a 1-slide summary or 2-minute verbal walkthrough to explain how you prioritized. Reference the criteria you used (value, effort, risk, etc.), not just the
  outcome. Include a lightweight explanation like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&quot;We prioritized this feature because it helps 70% of users, has a high trust impact, can be shipped in under two weeks, plus it builds trust and reduces resistance.&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Pitfalls to Avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't Flood Them with Data: Focus on clarity, not complexity.</li>
<li>
<p>Don't Wait for Perfect Info: Prioritize transparency over precision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get Alignment Early (Before You Announce the Plan)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Surprises break trust. Proactive conversations build it. Give others space to raise concerns before decisions feel locked in.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<p>Before finalizing your roadmap or sprint, check in with key stakeholders, such as design, engineering, sales, or leadership. Ask:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>“Here’s how I’m thinking about priorities. Does anything feel misaligned from your side?”
</code></pre></div>
<p>Pitfalls to Avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t Anounce Prirorities Without Input : Give a heads up as often as posssible.</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid Only Aligning Up With Leadership: Peer alignment is just as critical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage Trade-Offs Out Loud (Not Just in Your Head)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Trade-offs are inevitable. What matters is that others see you making them intentionally. Reframing trade-offs as intentional choices helps others understand your strategy.</p>
<p>Try this:
  When saying no (or “not now”), show what you’re saying yes to. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>“We’re holding off on this feature not because it’s a bad idea, but because the sync fix impacts more users and supports our Q3 retention goals.”
</code></pre></div>
<p>Pitfalls to Avoid:</p>
<p>❌ Don't Just Say "It's Not a Priority": Explain why.
  ❌ Don't Assume Trade-Offs are Obvious: Even great PMs forget others need context.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revisit Priorities as Inputs Change (and Let People Know When You Do)</li>
</ul>
<p>Prioritization isn’t a one-time event—it’s an ongoing practice. Build a simple habit of revisiting your prioritization assumptions every 2–4 weeks, especially when new user data comes in, resources shift, or a major opportunity or risk emerges.</p>
<p>Try this:
   Let others know when something changes and why. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>“Given the surge in feedback about calendar syncing, we’re moving it up from ‘Could-have’ to ‘Should-have’ in our next cycle.”
</code></pre></div>
<p>Pitfalls to Avoid:</p>
<p>❌ Don't Stick to a Plan Just Because It's Written Down: Adapt with intention.
  ❌ Don't Update Priorities Silently: Keep all teams in the loop to build trust and visibility.</p>
<p>Remember: Prioritization doesn’t end when you make the decision. It becomes real when others understand it, support it, and move forward with you.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Prioritization is about focus, not just ranking</li>
<li>You’ll never have enough time or resources to do everything. Great product managers make intentional choices about what to do next and what to say “no” to.</li>
<li>Use frameworks to bring structure and clarity</li>
<li>Whether it’s MoSCoW for fast alignment, RICE for lightweight scoring, or Weighted Scoring for deeper analysis, frameworks help you compare competing priorities through a consistent lens.</li>
<li>Apply the right tool for the moment</li>
<li>Each framework has its strengths. Use MoSCoW when you need to move quickly, RICE when you have data to guide you, and Weighted Scoring when alignment and customization matter most.</li>
<li>Communication is just as important as the decision itself</li>
<li>Getting buy-in means showing your logic, managing trade-offs transparently, and staying open to change as new insights come in. Prioritization is a team sport—and you're the one keeping everyone on the same page.</li>

<p>The launch event keynotes:</p>
<p>Should have</p>
<ul>
<li>product positioning: Why of the product</li>
<li>value proposition: What it enables users to do</li>
<li>excitement: Tell why you and (audience) should be excited about the product</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at steve jobs launch videos:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacBook Air launch</li>
<li>iPhone launch</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="product-launch-key-elements">Product launch key elements<a class="headerlink" href="#product-launch-key-elements" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c09f49c0-2fc4-4470-ac04-1437f71f9a8b" /></p>
<p>The four foundational elements of an effective product launch are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positioning</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>Pricing and Packaging</li>
<li>Competitive Intelligence</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically for foundational elements, you will need to ensure that each of these have their own dedicated work stream, and rely on internal stakeholders, such as Sales, Marketing, Customer Success or even senior level executives to help bring them to life.</p>
<h4 id="positioning">Positioning<a class="headerlink" href="#positioning" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>As such, developing and iterating on positioning should begin early on in the product development lifecycle, this way, everyone is on the same page from the beginning. Positioning is essential not only to help capture the attention of your target audiences, but also instrumental for your internal teams.</p>
<p>An effective product launch starts with positioning. Positioning provides all the crucial context about a product required to effectively build it and bring it to market.</p>
<p>Positioning allows to effective articulate your product’s position in the market by clearly stating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who your product serves (During MacBook air launch, steve jobs did not make this clear. But at the end of the keynote speech, you know that it was for everyone)</li>
<li>What your product does (Again, in the launch speech, steve jobs didn't mention that the MacBook air does anything extra. But he stressed that it does everything that larger laptops could do)</li>
<li>How your product is different (MacBook air's differentiator was slim profile. And still do everything that other laptops could do. So in the entire speech, steve jobs stressed on this one point only)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, all in all, you don't have to be a differentiator in all 3 aspects above. Any one is enough. </p>
<p>Having your internal teams understand these three core elements will help provide clarity and drive alignment. </p>
<p>Here are some questions you should ask yourself to gather relevant information for each of the six components and construct your framework.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is the core target audience for the product?</li>
<li>This product is for…</li>
<li>who is this product intended for, who will get the most value</li>
<li>What is the core need that you solve for them? Who want/need…</li>
<li>what problem is your product solving</li>
<li>What is your product? We offer…</li>
<li>what do you offer, how do you do it</li>
<li>What is our specific value that you provide to customers? Because of…</li>
<li>what benefits the customer will get by using your product. Remember, value is not the functionality of the product, but it is the benefit that the customer going to get. </li>
<li>What are the shortcomings that you must get past? Despite…</li>
<li>what push back you may received from the customer, how to overcome that.</li>
<li>In MacBook air launch speech, steve jobs has addressed the lack of CD drive. A limitation of MacBook air and a possible point of pushback. He also explained what apple is doing to workaround this limitation. And in doing so, the justified the priority decision they have taken about droping the cd drive.</li>
<li>How do you do this better than competing products? Better than…</li>
<li>talk about competitor devices, what areas are they lacking, how your product/service plug those gaps.</li>
<li>Steve jobs does this in MacBook air launch speech. Rather the speech start from that. He also brings in competitor phone's mention in iPhone speech. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="messaging">messaging<a class="headerlink" href="#messaging" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d324f25-c246-4c39-839b-65d641043a57" /></p>
<ul>
<li>if positioning is like defining goals for the product (who is it for, what need is catered to, what is the product etc), then the messaging is about communicating all this to the customers</li>
<li>So how is messaging developed? As mentioned, it comes from the core content you have defined in your positioning framework. However, one key element that is unique to messaging is that, while it is important to clearly communicate your product’s value and benefits, these must first be done in the context of the product in the general market. Using your messaging to set the stage on your point of view of the market is key to ensuring customers can attach meaning to why they need your product and why they should care about your product right now.</li>
<li>Messaging Pillars:
Remember that messaging is constructed from two parts: the context and the content. You’ve covered the market shift (aka the context), now it’s time to build your messaging pillars and get into the content.</li>
<li>In simple terms, think of constructing your messaging pillars as a three step plan:</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1: Articulate the values your product delivers to your customers.</p>
<p>Step 2: Highlight the specific product capabilities that deliver those values.</p>
<p>Step 3: Back it up with social proof.</p>
<ul>
<li>Messaging Activations:
  Once your messaging has been constructed around context and content, you can use it to create messaging activations across a variety of channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>These may be:</p>
<p>Marketing Copy: Web pages, emails, promotions, and other assets</p>
<p>In-Product Copy: Words that appear within the product to reinforce functionality and value</p>
<p>Sales Assets: Pitch decks, webinar narratives, and other materials used in B2B sales</p>
<p>Just remember, for your messaging to be most effective it needs to be consistent - even if it's been tailored to marketing, sales, or is kept for in-product copy.</p>
<h4 id="pricing-and-packaging">Pricing and packaging<a class="headerlink" href="#pricing-and-packaging" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>pricing and packaging needs to be finalized before your product is ready to launch. This is to ensure that there is alignment between internal teams and key stakeholders.</p>
<ul>
<li>packaging: The grouping of features or attributes into different bundles (gluu vs Solo (gluu's cloud offering)), (basic vs pro subscription plans)</li>
<li>pricing: Amount of money that you charge for each bundle</li>
</ul>
<p>As your pricing and packaging develops, there are three key steps to plan for to ensure that you are ready to launch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Test the pricing and bundling</li>
<li>check and ask a small set of customers or sales teams to experiment with xyz price to see the customer response</li>
<li>Enable customer facing teams: make sure that the teams like customer success, PR, marketing, sales etc are up-to-date of pricing and packaging before the launch. This can be done via video conference, etc</li>
<li>update and test systems: systems like company website, CRM, inventory etc where the orders are going to come should be updated with new data and should be kept ready before the launch. Make sure that systems like websites don't reveal products before launch.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="competitive-intelligence">Competitive Intelligence<a class="headerlink" href="#competitive-intelligence" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>And the final foundational element is competitive intelligence, which is relevant for all functions related to an effective product launch. </p>
<p>What is it? Competitive intelligence is the practice of collecting and sharing knowledge about competitors to improve organizational performance. </p>
<p>Who can benefit from competitive intelligence?</p>
<p>Product Managers: to make sure that they are building differentiated products. </p>
<p>Product Marketers: to influence the positioning and messaging that we just talked about. </p>
<p>Sales Reps: to make sure that they're armed with the relevant information they need to win deals.</p>
<p>Where can you find the information you need to build your competitive intelligence?</p>
<ul>
<li>Competitor's website</li>
<li>help and product documentation</li>
<li>your sales teams</li>
<li>your partner ecosystem</li>
<li>Review sites like G2</li>
<li>industry analysts</li>
<li>win/loss interviews</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="go-to-market-gtm-plan">Go to market (GTM) plan<a class="headerlink" href="#go-to-market-gtm-plan" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>What is a GTM plan?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is basically what, who, when, how plan a product or a feature to the market. It has details about how to conduct a launch event, to communication and marketing, to planning for content for communication and marketing, what parameters to measure to decide if the launch was success, beta releases etc </p>
<h4 id="what">What<a class="headerlink" href="#what" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>What are you releasing and does it need GTM?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you need GTM for this release?</li>
</ul>
<p>A company may be releasing a completely new product, or a major revision/version of a flagship product, or a major feature in a product, or a minor feature in a product. 
  Not all the releases need a Go-To-Market effort. A minor feature can be just release with an accompaniying blog on the company website. No major launch event like iPhone is needed. So, not everything needs a GTM/launch event.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First decide what kind of launch is needed for this release?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tier-1: Big launch event hosted by company, engagement on all channels</p>
<ul>
<li>This is required if a new product is being launched, or a major upgrade to company's main product where this upgrade is going to touch every or majority of company's customer base. Like iPhone's next upgrade. Or Launching iPad air.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tier-2: No event or small company launch event with specific on-invite audience. Engagement on <code>owned</code> channels only, like company website.<ul>
<li>When a smaller feature or product gets released. This feature is of interest for only specific set of customers. Like for example, feature for enterprise customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tier-3: Release and then tell. A minor feature or release that touches many people but the feature is not significant. Just a blog on company website announcing availability of the feature is enough. Like service pack release for OS. </li>
</ul>
<p>Ask yourself the following questions to help determine which tier your launch might fall into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reach: How many customers will be affected? Usually, more customers mean more visibility.</li>
<li>Impact: What is the potential impact on overall business goals and the user experience? Will it drive growth and revenue? Is it worth being proactive to help us achieve more ambitious goals more quickly? Do we need users to change their actions somehow?</li>
<li>Risk: What risk is there if this feature is not communicated proactively to users? Will there be blowback?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="who">Who<a class="headerlink" href="#who" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>Knowing who you are launching for by identifying your target audience is another key element to consider in your go-to-market plan.</p>
<p>While you will likely have an idea of who your product is for, there are some additional granularities to consider when building your go-to-market plan. Developing a more rigorous set of audiences will set you up to develop a channel plan that will reach them effectively, so this is a crucial step. </p>
<p>Your primary question should be: ‘Who am I aiming to connect with and market our product to?’</p>
<p>Here are some potential questions to consider when deciding on who you aim to target:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you trying to reach current customers or attract new ones?</li>
<li>Are you adjusting your go-to-market based on whether a customer is a subscriber or not?</li>
<li>Are you adjusting your go-to-market to consider lapsed inactive customers? How might you target them if they’re not actively using your product?</li>
<li>Are you considering your go-to-market approach based on how long a user has been using your product?</li>
<li>
<p>Do these audiences have specific titles, work in specific regions, certain industries or have other similar characteristics?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the goals of this GTM?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually there are three catagories in which a GTM initiative would set it's goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness</li>
<li>Engagement</li>
<li>Conversion and revenue impact</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the target for</p>
<ul>
<li>user engagement: how frequently and how much time users are spending with your product</li>
<li>new user on-boarding: how many new users the product has gained after launch</li>
<li>user churn: How many users have stopped using your product after launch  </li>
<li>Revenue impact</li>
<li>user conversion rates: how many users have actually started paying for your product</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What metrics are being used?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your metrics should highlight and explain what you’re tracking for your launch and how you will evaluate progress towards success.</p>
<p>These may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantitatively: with numbers or percentages showing if you achieved or exceed your metrics for the launch.</li>
<li>Qualitatively: with positive feedback or industry recognition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>GTM timelines</p>
</li>
<li>Schedule for each activity. When to release beta, when to have launch event, when to update websites with new content about this product, when to send product/feature briefs to the sales/marketing teams,</li>
<li>It is important to build your go-to-market timeline so you can figure out exactly when and over what time horizon to bring your plan to life.</li>
<li>But remember, a go-to-market plan is not a one-off moment in time. It's a structured journey ensuring engagement and growth over longer time horizons, so consider a phased approach so there’s sustainable momentum after your initial launch date. Your GTM plan should include:<ul>
<li>A high level timeline that shows exactly when certain channels and marketing tactics will go live.</li>
<li>Potential breakdown of different phases of product launch and what the goals are for each phase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phased approach:</p>

Many GTM plans include multiple channel activations to amplify the launch moment and then cycle through additional channels over time to sustain engagement. Check out this example of a typical phased marketing plan approach. As you can see, it has been divided into three phases. The key is that each phase has been designed to achieve a specific goal with tactics and channels to match:<a class="headerlink" href="#-breaking-down-the-different-phases-of-your-launch-can-help-strategically-place-activities-for-sustained-momentum-while-also-planning-for-maximum-initial-impact-many-gtm-plans-include-multiple-channel-activations-to-amplify-the-launch-moment-and-then-cycle-through-additional-channels-over-time-to-sustain-engagement-check-out-this-example-of-a-typical-phased-marketing-plan-approach-as-you-can-see-it-has-been-divided-into-three-phases-the-key-is-that-each-phase-has-been-designed-to-achieve-a-specific-goal-with-tactics-and-channels-to-match" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Beta/early access
    <img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b6f3521-2bfe-47cf-aece-555935373c79" /></li>
<li>Phase 2: Launch moment
    <img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d3e64ce-5a68-4c49-b11d-defa56b93e53" /></li>
<li>Phase 3: Post launch adoption
    <img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8bf13bf-b3f5-43bc-a0bf-c05c20c85890" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enablement Plan</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since you will likely be working with a variety of key stakeholders in order to get your product successfully launched, ensure that your enablement plan keeps everyone informed and on the same page.</p>
<p>Every launch (or release!) will require some level of enablement to ensure that internal stakeholders have the information they need. Different teams have different priorities and tasks, so make sure that you are sharing your enablement documents to help everyone contextualize the product and get up to speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who needs to know?
    Revenue Enablement, Sales, Customer Support, Social, Marketing, and PR are your primary stakeholders who would benefit from your enablement plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do they need to know?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Product Description: Keep the formula clear and concise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try (type of product) + (main benefit)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Its Key Features: List them separately using snappy, action verbs.</p>
<p>Try enables / monitors / tracks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How it Works: Include a quick product demo so that these stakeholders quickly understand it and explain how to use it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channel Plan</p>
<p>Channel plans can help you identify which channels to use for your launch. Great go-to-market plans incorporate and leverage a mix of different channels that work to achieve specific goals. </p>
<p>Channels are dictated by:</p>
<p>Your campaign goals and metrics
Your target audiences
Think about it this way: if your goal is to reactivate lapsed or inactive users of your fitness app, you shouldn’t rely too heavily on in-app messages, since those users won’t see them anyway!
Three Common Kinds of Channels to Think About
In order for your messaging to reach the right audiences, your channel plan should incorporate the three most common channels: owned, paid and earned.</p>
<ul>
<li>Owned channels:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d5fcb1c-f2e5-44b9-b0c1-d52dbc22223f" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Paid channels:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21a3ae32-7fd3-46f3-beab-225a03d42701" /></p>
<ul>
<li>earned channels:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b32fc10-d910-478c-9cce-b19048894157" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch Assets</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to fully bring you go-to-market plan to life, you will need to develop and build assets to generate awareness, interest and excitement in your product. These assets will play a crucial role in your launch strategy and are the final piece of the go-to-market puzzle.</p>
<p>There are many different types of assets, and each serves a different function or is useful for different teams. Whichever you choose, be sure that your vision and message for your product launch is clearly understood and communicated - especially when getting help from your creative teams.</p>
<ul>
<li>sales slides</li>
<li>landing pages</li>
<li>one pagers</li>
<li>email templates</li>
<li>customer stories</li>
<li>Blog posts</li>
<li>webinars</li>
<li>Launch videos</li>
<li>Interactive product tours</li>
<li>demo environments for sales</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind: Product Marketing Managers (PMMs) in particular are your key partners for go-to-market. They can help support go-to-market activities like segmenting customers, choosing the appropriate customer acquisition channels, and creating external-facing messaging.  </p>

<h4 id="user-research">User research<a class="headerlink" href="#user-research" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>useful to understand customer's</p>
<ul>
<li>behaviour</li>
<li>needs</li>
<li>motivations</li>
<li>pain points</li>
</ul>
<p>Two main types of user research: </p>
<ul>
<li>Behavioural</li>
<li>Focuses on what users <strong>do</strong></li>
<li>Observes actions and interaction with the product</li>
<li>Attitudinal</li>
<li>Explores what users <strong>say</strong></li>
<li>Gathers feedback about products experiences and opinions</li>
</ul>
<p>Two main methods of conducting any user research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantitative</li>
<li>Offers measurable data to be analysed (surveys, data matrics)</li>
<li>Qualitative</li>
<li>Provides insights into user's motivations and experiences (interviews, focus group discussions)</li>
